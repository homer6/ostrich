## Wings of Contention: International Scientific Interest Intensifies Fight to Save 400 BC Ostriches

**Edgewood, B.C.** – In the serene Kootenay region of British Columbia, a 65-acre family-run ostrich farm has become the epicenter of a legal and ethical maelstrom with international implications. Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (UOF) is locked in a high-stakes battle against the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) over a cull order for its approximately 400 ostriches, issued after an H5N1 avian influenza detection. The case, already a poignant struggle between a federal agency's mandate and a family's livelihood, has been dramatically reshaped by a direct intervention from top U.S. health officials, underscoring the flock's unique scientific value and questioning the necessity of the cull.

**The Farm, Its Keepers, and a Shift to Science:**

For over three decades, Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski have nurtured Universal Ostrich Farms. Their daughter, Katie Pasitney, has emerged as the public voice of their fight. Initially a traditional farm, UOF pivoted around 2020 towards a novel research focus: extracting immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibodies from ostrich eggs. This work, involving collaborations with entities like Kyoto Prefectural University, aims to develop diagnostics or therapeutics for human viruses. To its owners, the flock represents not just decades of selective breeding, but a living bio-resource of immense potential – a claim now resonating at the highest levels of international health.

**The Outbreak and the CFIA's Swift Action:**

The crisis ignited in early December 2024 when, following exposure to wild ducks, some UOF ostriches exhibited respiratory symptoms. After an anonymous tip regarding ostrich deaths, the CFIA intervened on December 28, 2024, imposing a quarantine. Swab samples from two deceased birds on December 30 returned positive for H5 avian influenza the next day. Within a mere 41 minutes of this preliminary result, the CFIA issued a "Notice to Dispose," mandating the destruction of the entire flock by February 1, 2025, under its "Stamping-Out Policy." Subsequent tests confirmed HPAI H5N1.

**A Plea for Exemption and a Judicial Setback:**

UOF sought an exemption, arguing their flock was a "distinct epidemiological unit" with "rare and valuable poultry genetics." They highlighted their breeding program and the belief that many birds had developed natural immunity, especially as the last flu-related death was on January 15, 2025, with the remaining flock reportedly healthy since.

On January 10, 2025, the CFIA denied the exemption. The agency cited biosecurity concerns and found insufficient proof of genetic rarity under its traditional criteria (e.g., breeding books, recognized breed testing), which UOF argued overlooked the "acquired scientific rarity" of a potentially immune, research-critical flock.

UOF pursued a judicial review. On May 13, 2025, Justice Russel W. Zinn of the Federal Court dismissed their applications. He underscored that his review was confined to the CFIA's reasonableness and procedural fairness based *only on the information available to the agency at the time of its decisions (December 2024/January 2025)*. Justice Zinn found the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy reasonable, consistent with its mandate, international obligations (WOAH), and the need to protect public health and Canada's poultry industry. He affirmed the deference owed to CFIA's expertise.

**The Game-Changing HHS Letter and Its Impact:**

The landscape of the case dramatically shifted post-decision with a letter dated May 23, 2025, to the CFIA President from the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This unprecedented intervention has profound implications:

1.  **Validation of Unique Scientific Value:** The HHS letter powerfully corroborates UOF's central claim. It states, "we believe there is significant value in studying this population" for H5N1 natural history, immune longevity, antibody levels, cellular immunity, and therapeutic potential. This directly challenges the CFIA's (and Justice Zinn's upholding of) a potentially narrow interpretation of "rare and valuable genetics," which focused on traditional breed registry standards rather than acquired scientific research value.

2.  **Reframing "Public Interest" and "International Obligations":** The CFIA's stance heavily relies on the "Stamping-Out Policy" aligning with WOAH guidelines and being crucial for trade. The HHS letter introduces a compelling *countervailing international public interest* – the advancement of global scientific understanding of H5N1, advocated by a major trading partner. It proposes international collaboration to *study*, not cull, the ostriches, offering an alternative to a monolithic interpretation of Canada's international duties.

3.  **Questioning Proportionality and Necessity of Culling:** The U.S. officials explicitly state that culling the flock now, months after infection and with observed recovery, "will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds" and is a "potentially disproportionate measure." This expert international opinion bolsters arguments that the CFIA's inflexible adherence to policy is unreasonable in this specific, evolved context.

**Current Status and the Path Forward:**

The ostriches, as of late May 2025, remain alive. UOF has announced its intention to appeal Justice Zinn's decision. The HHS letter, while not before Justice Zinn, will be a critical piece of context for the Court of Appeal. It doesn't retroactively make Zinn's decision wrong (he couldn't have considered it), but it powerfully suggests that the CFIA's original assessment of the flock's value and the ongoing necessity of the cull order may have been flawed or overly narrow.

The appeal will argue that Justice Zinn erred in law or in his application of the reasonableness standard. The HHS intervention significantly strengthens arguments related to:
*   The CFIA's failure to adequately consider the unique scientific value of the flock.
*   The disproportionality of culling healthy, potentially immune birds vital for research, especially months after the outbreak.
*   The procedural fairness of the CFIA's decision-making process, particularly regarding the commissioned report and the narrow application of exemption criteria.

The Regional District of Central Kootenay's (RDCK) vote on May 15, 2025, to refuse the ostrich carcasses at its landfills until the CFIA re-tests the currently healthy birds and publicizes the results, adds another layer of complexity for the CFIA.

**A Broader Impact:**

The Universal Ostrich Farms case has transcended a local animal health issue. It now stands at the intersection of regulatory authority, scientific discovery, animal welfare, international collaboration, and the very definition of "public good." The intervention by top U.S. health officials elevates the stakes, framing the preservation of this specific flock as a matter of international scientific importance. While the CFIA emphasizes its mandate to protect Canada's agricultural economy and public health from the established risks of HPAI, the U.S. letter posits a compelling argument that, in this unique instance, a greater public good might be served by preserving and studying these resilient ostriches. The outcome of the appeal, and any subsequent CFIA actions, will be closely watched by scientific communities, agricultural bodies, and animal welfare advocates on both sides of the border and beyond.
