## Wings of Contention: International Scientific Interest and Farmer Rights Fuel Appeal in BC Ostrich Cull Case

**Edgewood, B.C.** – In the serene Kootenay region of British Columbia, a 65-acre family-run ostrich farm has become the epicenter of a legal and ethical maelstrom with international implications. Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (UOF), managed by Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski for over 30 years, is appealing a Federal Court decision that upheld the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) order to euthanize their flock of approximately 400 ostriches following an H5N1 avian influenza detection. The case, already a poignant struggle, has been significantly amplified by a direct intervention from top U.S. health officials highlighting the flock's unique scientific value, while the farm itself, through spokesperson Katie Pasitney, frames its ongoing battle as a fight for broader agricultural policy reform and farmers' rights.

**The Farm, Its Keepers, and a Shift to Science:**

Universal Ostrich Farms has a long history of selective breeding. Around 2020, its focus significantly shifted towards scientific research, particularly the extraction of immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibodies from ostrich eggs. This work, involving collaborations with entities like Kyoto Prefectural University, aims to develop diagnostics or therapeutics for human viruses. To its owners, the flock represents not just decades of dedication, but a living bio-resource of immense potential – a claim now strongly echoed by international health authorities.

**The Outbreak and the CFIA's Swift Action:**

The crisis began in early December 2024 when, after reported exposure to wild ducks, some UOF ostriches exhibited respiratory symptoms. Following an anonymous tip, the CFIA intervened on December 28, 2024. Swab samples from two deceased birds on December 30 returned positive for H5 avian influenza the next day. Within 41 minutes of this preliminary result, the CFIA issued a "Notice to Dispose," mandating the destruction of the entire flock by February 1, 2025, under its "Stamping-Out Policy." Subsequent tests confirmed HPAI H5N1.

**A Plea for Exemption and a Judicial Setback:**

UOF sought an exemption, arguing their flock was a "distinct epidemiological unit" with "rare and valuable poultry genetics." They highlighted their breeding program and the belief that many birds had developed natural immunity, especially as the last flu-related death was on January 15, 2025, with the remaining flock reportedly healthy since.

On January 10, 2025, the CFIA denied the exemption, citing biosecurity concerns and finding insufficient proof of genetic rarity under its traditional criteria, which UOF argued overlooked the "acquired scientific rarity" of a potentially immune, research-critical flock.

UOF pursued a judicial review. On May 13, 2025, Justice Russel W. Zinn of the Federal Court dismissed their applications. He emphasized that his review was confined to the CFIA's reasonableness and procedural fairness based *only on the information available to the agency at the time of its decisions (December 2024/January 2025)*. Justice Zinn found the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy reasonable and consistent with its mandate and international obligations.

**The Game-Changing HHS Letter and Its Impact:**

The landscape of the case dramatically shifted post-decision with a letter dated May 23, 2025, to the CFIA President from the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This unprecedented intervention has profound implications:
1.  **Validation of Unique Scientific Value:** The HHS letter powerfully corroborates UOF's central claim, stating, "we believe there is significant value in studying this population" for H5N1 natural history, immune longevity, and therapeutic potential. This challenges the CFIA's potentially narrow interpretation of "value."
2.  **Reframing "Public Interest" and "International Obligations":** The HHS letter introduces a compelling *countervailing international public interest* – the advancement of global scientific understanding of H5N1, advocated by a major trading partner. It proposes international collaboration to *study*, not cull, the ostriches.
3.  **Questioning Proportionality and Necessity of Culling:** The U.S. officials explicitly state that culling the flock now, months after infection and with observed recovery, "will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds" and is a "potentially disproportionate measure."

**UOF's Appeal and Broader Fight: Current Status and Path Forward**

Universal Ostrich Farms, as confirmed by Katie Pasitney in a Facebook update on May 26, 2025, has officially filed an appeal against Justice Zinn's decision. Pasitney clarified the current situation: "No order halting enforcement or no court order halting enforcement has been issued. What they have agreed upon is that if we get our stay motion which is next approved on an expedited... timely manner... then they will halt the order." This indicates a temporary pause by agreement, contingent on the success of their stay motion.

Beyond the immediate legal challenge to overturn Justice Zinn's ruling, UOF's public position, articulated by Pasitney, frames their fight in much broader terms. "This is all about the rights of Canadians protecting our farmers," she stated, emphasizing a direct challenge to the CFIA's "stamping out policy," which she described as "an outdated policy that needs revamping and it needs to be readjusted to protect our farmers and to protect our Canadians."

UOF is advocating for a more collaborative and science-driven approach. Pasitney highlighted the CFIA's previous statements about being "always open to new science" and extended an invitation: "We're really inviting them to let us help them, let us help you." This call for cooperation is underscored by the farm's belief in the unique immunological characteristics of their flock, a belief now bolstered by the significant international interest from the HHS. Pasitney expressed hope that the HHS letter "would open a door for us to work with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency," allowing for study rather than destruction.

The farm is also pushing for systemic changes, seeking "more accountability" from the CFIA, a "revamp" of policies they deem ineffective, and critically, "the right to test or treat your own animals," which Pasitney argues "should be a human right."

The Regional District of Central Kootenay's (RDCK) vote on May 15, 2025, to refuse the ostrich carcasses at its landfills until the CFIA re-tests the currently healthy birds and publicizes the results, adds another layer of complexity for the CFIA should the cull proceed.

**A Broader Impact:**

The Universal Ostrich Farms case has evolved from a localized animal health crisis into a multifaceted battle with far-reaching implications. The appeal is not merely a legalistic challenge to a court ruling but a public call, spearheaded by the farm, for a paradigm shift in how animal health crises are managed, particularly when unique scientific opportunities, long-standing agricultural practices, and fundamental farmers' rights are at stake. The CFIA faces the dual pressures of upholding its existing mandate and policies while contending with compelling international scientific interest and a passionate, publicly-articulated demand for policy reform and collaboration from the affected farmers. The outcome will be closely watched by scientific communities, agricultural bodies, and animal welfare advocates globally.
