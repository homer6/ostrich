# I. Overview

[1] The Applicant, Universal Ostrich Farms Inc., challenges two related decisions made by the Respondent, Canadian Food Inspection Agency [the CFIA or the Agency], under section 48 of the Health of Animals Act, SC 1990, c 21 [the Act]. The first decision, a Notice to Dispose issued on December 31, 2024, ordered the destruction of all ostriches on the farm after laboratory tests confirmed infection with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI]. The second, an Exemption Denial, dated January 10, 2025, refused the farm's request to spare the flock on the basis that the ostriches formed a self-contained, unexposed "distinct epidemiological unit" with "rare and valuable poultry genetics," thus qualifying for an exemption from the Notice to Dispose under the CFIA's Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 2022 Event Response Plan [the 2022 ERP].

[2] At the heart of this proceeding lies an inevitable tension between the CFIA's mandate to protect public health and the Applicant's wish to preserve its ostriches. Parliament has charged the CFIA with preventing the spread of designated zoonotic and enzootic diseases and with protecting the food supply, public health, and Canada's reputation in global trade. To do so, the Agency complies with the internationally recognized and applied "Stamping-Out Policy" approach recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health [WOAH] that requires rapid culling of affected avian populations. Conversely, the Applicant faces the loss of decades of selective breeding work, disruption to valuable commercial and scientific research, and destruction of birds that might no longer pose an active, ongoing risk of transmitting HPAI. Against this backdrop, the Applicant contends that the CFIA has, in issuing the Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial, disregarded its unique circumstances and fallen short of providing basic procedural fairness.

[3] These two applications address whether the CFIA's decisions were reasonable and procedurally fair based on facts available to the Agency at the time. This is not an appeal. The Court is not stepping into the shoes of the Agency and making the decisions that the Court feels ought to have been made. Instead, the focus of the review is on the Agency's reasoning and process.

[4] I dismiss both applications for judicial review. The Agency's decisions were reasonable based on the record before the decision-maker and were made in a procedurally fair manner.

[5] Courts must respect Parliament's choice to assign decision-making power to administrative bodies. This respect comes from the principle of separation of powers, a cornerstone of Canadian public law: Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, 2015 FCA 17 at para 30. The separation of powers compels courts to respect the legislature's choice to assign decision-making power to specialized administrative bodies, such as the CFIA, rather than to the judiciary: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] at para 30.

[6] Courts must also respect the demonstrated scientific and technical expertise of administrative agencies. In administrative law, courts generally stay out of scientific debates and focus on whether the decision-makers used their expertise to make reasonable and procedurally fair decisions. When Parliament leaves technical or scientific assessments to specialized administrative bodies, it signals that those bodies, not the courts, are best positioned to make judgments on complex, expertise-driven matters. Indeed, Canadian administrative law explicitly warns that courts must not resolve scientific disputes or substitute their own views for those of specialized decision-makers authorized by Parliament to handle such issues: Vavilov at para 93. Judges are experts in law, not in public health, virology, epidemiology, or veterinary medicine. This case undeniably has a strong technical flavour. Both parties have submitted expert affidavits supported by scientific literature. The role of this Court is not to conduct afresh its own studies of that material and decide which science is correct, but to determine whether the CFIA's decisions were reasonable and procedurally fair based on the record before it.

[7] Judicial review hinges on what was before the decision-maker. With very few exceptions, reviewing courts on judicial review must mentally travel back to the moment when the decision was made, and judge the decision with only the evidence that was before the decision-maker at that moment. Here, the dates are December 31, 2024 for the Notice to Dispose and January 10, 2025 for the Exemption Denial. A reviewing court must assess administrative decisions based exclusively on the information available to the decision-makers at the time they made those decisions: Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 FCA 22 at para 19; Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v Alberta Teachers' Association, 2011 SCC 61 at paras 22-26.

[8] If courts conducted judicial review with information that did not exist at the time of decision-making, they would be faulting decision-makers for lacking a crystal ball. No one has the gift of foresight, so courts must avoid reviewing decisions through the lens of hindsight. Therefore, this Court cannot consider "new" evidence, such as the current health status of the ostriches, recent test results, or updated scientific developments that become available only after January 10, 2025, the date of the Agency's last decision.

[9] Concepts like "reasonableness" and "procedural fairness" have specific meanings in administrative law, defined and refined over years of jurisprudence. Reasonableness asks whether the CFIA's explanation of its decisions tells a compelling story of how it reached them. Whether the story is compelling enough depends on whether the outcome and reasons are logically supported by the evidence on record, consistent with applicable law, and aligned with the Agency's past practices and own policies. Reasonableness does not ask whether the outcome is the best or most persuasive course of action.

[10] Procedural fairness is about the decision-making process itself, not the outcome. This assessment asks questions such as whether the Applicant received timely notice, whether the Applicant had meaningful chance to be heard, and whether the CFIA followed the procedures that it promised it would. In this context, fairness is not about whether the substantive outcome feels fair in an everyday understanding, but whether the CFIA adhered to the required legal standards of fairness in the process it followed to reach its decisions. Keeping these legal meanings in mind helps avoid the understandable, but legally misplaced, reaction of equating "harsh outcome" with "unfair decision."

[11] This Court accepts that there is a real and negative impact of the CFIA's two decisions on the Applicant and its principals. Beyond the economic loss, the destruction of a long-established ostrich population is also a source of emotional distress, particularly given the decades of work and investment the principals have dedicated to breeding and raising their flock. I have considerable sympathy for them.

[12] Nonetheless, such personal losses must be weighed against the broader public interest in protecting public health and maintaining trade stability. Avian influenza is a virus capable of causing serious harm to both animals and humans, with significant implications for Canada's poultry businesses and international trade status. To combat threats like this virus, Parliament has authorized the CFIA to act decisively making swift decisions with far-reaching consequences, often under conditions of scientific uncertainty. This is a challenging mandate.

# II. Background

## A. The parties

[13] The Applicant operates a privately owned ostrich farm and research business located approximately ten kilometres outside Edgewood, British Columbia. The 65-acre operation is primarily managed by two principals with ostrich husbandry and selective breeding experience dating back to the mid-1990s. Over the years, the Applicant has diversified its business portfolio to encompass operations in selling breeding stock, raising birds for slaughter, processing limited amounts of meat, offering agri-tourism tours, and, in recent years, focusing on extracting immunoglobulin Y from ostrich eggs for use in human-virus diagnostics.

[14] The CFIA has the statutory authority granted by the Act and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, SC 1997, c 6. While commonly associated with the regulation of food safety and quality in Canada, the Agency's broader mandate includes preventing and controlling communicable diseases in animals and plants that threaten public health, environmental integrity, or Canada's economic interests, including international trade in livestock and animal products. In furtherance of this mandate, the CFIA administers the 2022 ERP, which is the latest formalization and operationalization of the Stamping-Out Policy. The Agency reports to the Minister of Health, except where the Act assigns powers, duties, or functions to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for matters unrelated to food safety.

## B. The avian influenza virus

[15] Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is caused by influenza A viruses. Like all viruses, avian influenza viruses cannot replicate on their own and must infect hosts to do so. Their usual hosts are wild birds. Migratory waterfowl, particularly wild ducks, serve as natural hosts, potentially returning from their overwintering grounds each year with new viral variants. These viruses can also occasionally spread to domestic birds and, more rarely and sporadically, to mammals like humans.

[16] For domestic birds, transmission of the virus can occur through direct contact with infected wild or domestic birds, as well as through indirect exposure to contaminated environments. The ability of avian influenza to persist in the environment contributes to its transmission. It can persist outside of hosts in feces, grass, and soil. It can remain viable for months or even years in fresh water at low temperatures, creating long-lasting sources of infection or re-infection. On small holding operations like the Applicant's ostrich farm, common risk factors for transmission include direct contact between domestic and wild birds, proximity to environments such as wetlands, ponds, swamps, lakes, rivers, and grain fields, and the acquisition of birds with unknown health status.

[17] Human infection with avian influenza is rare but potentially deadly. Infection typically occurs through close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments, particularly where appropriate personal protective equipment and hygiene measures are lacking. Some strains of the virus are particularly lethal. For instance, approximately half of the more than 900 reported cases of human H5N1 infection worldwide since 1997 have resulted in death.

[18] Each strain of the avian influenza is identified by two special proteins on its surface: hemagglutinin, designated "H," and neuraminidase, designated "N." Hemagglutinin helps the virus bind to and enter host cells, while neuraminidase enables release and propagation of the virus from the host cells. The combination of H and N proteins plays a large role in deciding which specific animals the virus can infect, how easily it spreads, and how the host immune system recognizes and reacts to it. To date, sixteen hemagglutinin subtypes, H1-H16, and nine neuraminidase subtypes, N1-N9, have been documented in birds, producing the familiar binomial viral strain names such as "H5N1" or "H7N9."

[19] However, knowing the H and N subtypes of an avian influenza strain alone does not sufficiently reveal how harmful it is for birds. The avian influenza ability to cause serious disease, or its "pathogenicity," strongly depends on a small section of the hemagglutinin protein called the "cleavage site." At this site, certain host enzymes must cut the hemagglutinin to activate the virus. Depending on the sequence of amino acids at the cleavage site, the virus may either spread systematically throughout the host's body and damage multiple organs, or stay limited to the lungs, kidneys, or gastrointestinal tract and cause less serious consequences. In other words, the level of pathogenicity of avian influenza in birds depends heavily on the molecular structure of its cleavage site, as revealed by the amino acid sequence there.

[20] To find out the pathogenicity of a particular strain of avian influenza, one performs pathotyping. This usually involves testing three things: the subtype of hemagglutinin, the subtype of neuraminidase, and the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site. To do this, the laboratory technique called real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RRTPCR] is used to detect the genes for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase and identify their subtypes, such as "H5" and "N1." To analyze the cleavage site, the part of the hemagglutinin gene containing the cleavage site is amplified and then sequenced to see whether it has the amino acid pattern linked to high or low pathogenicity avian influenza [LPAI].

## C. Avian influenza outbreaks in Canada

[21] Canada first confronted a major HPAI outbreak in 2004 in British Columbia. In February of that year, an LPAI H7N3 virus was detected in the Fraser Valley region. By March, the virus had mutated into an HPAI, spreading rapidly across both commercial and non-commercial premises. To contain the virus, over 14 million birds were disposed of. Two human cases were reported, both presenting with conjunctivitis and mild influenza-like symptoms. Both individuals recovered fully. The outbreak was declared over by June 2004.

[22] Several smaller HPAI events occurred between 2004 and the current outbreak. The most significant occurred in 2015, when North America faced widespread outbreaks of H5N2 and H5N8 HPAI strains. In Canada, the impact was concentrated primarily in commercial poultry flocks in Ontario.

[23] The current nationwide HPAI outbreak began in November 2021 and has affected every province except Prince Edward Island. The outbreak started with detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in wild bird populations in Canada before spreading to domestic poultry. Since then, HPAI has been confirmed on 527 domestic premises across the country, with British Columbia reporting the highest number of cases and some premises experiencing repeated infections. The outbreak has affected operations ranging from small backyard flocks to large scale commercial farms. Canada also recorded its first domestically acquired human case in late 2024, when a British Columbia teenager became critically ill and required intensive care. The individual has since made a full recovery.

# III. Facts

## A. The Applicant's ostrich operation

[24] The Applicant's property features open-air enclosures with shared facilities and proximity to wildlife. The farm is arranged with fenced and cross-fenced areas intended to separate groups of ostriches for breeding and care, while also providing a degree of biosecurity. No roofed barns segregate ostriches of different age groups. A large natural pond, routinely visited by wild ducks and other waterfowl, lies near the centre, in between two of the outdoor bird pens.

[25] The Applicant has developed what it considers a uniquely large strain of ostriches through selective breeding since the 1990s. The ostriches are allegedly selected for body size and favourable genetic traits, with surplus birds not meeting these standards being discarded or culled. Some ostriches currently on the farm trace back to early imports from Africa and remain part of the breeding stock.

[26] From approximately 2020 onward, the Applicant shifted its primary commercial focus to extracting and studying antibodies, notably immunoglobulin Y, from ostrich eggs. For the Applicant, these antibodies have lucrative commercial and research values, especially in the development of diagnostics or therapeutics relevant to human viruses, such as the COVID-19 causing virus of SARS-CoV-2. To advance this antibody-based venture, the Applicant has collaborated with both domestic and international partners, including scientific researchers and private sector entities. Despite this strategic shift, some level of ostrich sales, along with sales or planned sales of products derived from ostrich fat and eggshells, continued through to at least December 2024.

[27] By early December 2024, the farm reportedly housed about 450 ostriches, including older breeding stock and newly introduced birds.

## B. Infections, investigations, and CFIA interventions

[28] In February 2020, the Applicant's ostriches experienced a significant illness, reportedly resulting in roughly ten deaths. Laboratory tests confirmed bacterial infections caused by Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Although unsupported by laboratory findings, the farm's principals speculated in hindsight that avian influenza might have contributed to the illness. Most ostriches were said to have recovered within weeks, leading the principals to suspect survivors might have developed natural immunity to future outbreaks of HPAI.

[29] In early December 2024, a new outbreak of respiratory symptoms emerged shortly after wild duck exposure. The Applicant observed respiratory or "flu-like" symptoms among a subset of ostriches, reminiscent of the 2020 illness. According to the farm's principals, those symptoms appeared roughly one week after "300-500 ducks ... landed on the premises." By late December, mortalities began increasing, particularly among newer ostriches, prompting consultation with a local veterinarian. Approximately 25 to 30 ostriches died within a three-week period.

[30] The CFIA intervened on December 28, 2024, following an anonymous report of multiple ostrich deaths at the Applicant's premises. The Agency promptly contacted the Applicant and imposed a verbal quarantine order on the premises, with formal documentation to follow. The next day, the Applicant requested that a CFIA veterinarian assess the flock for avian influenza. Four additional ostriches died that same day.

[31] On December 30, 2024, CFIA inspectors visited the premises, collected swab samples from two carcasses suitable for laboratory testing, noted wild-bird activity at the pond, and observed that staff and equipment were shared and moved freely among open pens. That same day, the CFIA sent the Applicant a Declaration of Infected Place pursuant to section 22 of the Act and a Requirement to Quarantine per section 91.4 of the Health of Animals Regulations, CRC, c 296. These orders imposed movement controls and established biosecurity measures aimed at containing the HPAI outbreak on the Applicant's premises by preventing access to infected birds, carcasses, and contaminated areas by wild birds, other animals, and people.

[32] On December 31, 2024, the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network laboratory in Abbotsford, British Columbia, reported positive test results for the H5 avian influenza subtype. On January 3, 2025, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg, Manitoba, confirmed through genome sequencing that the pathogen was a HPAI subtype, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, and noted the virus's cleavage-site motif with amino acids "PLREKRRKR/GLF" was "compatible with HPAI viruses that came to Canada via the Pacific's flyway."

[33] The CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose on December 31, 2024, immediately after receiving confirmation of a positive test result for H5 avian influenza. Just 41 minutes after obtaining the test result, the CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose as guided by the 2022 ERP and pursuant to subsection 48(3) of the Act. The CFIA set February 1, 2025, as the deadline for disposal of all affected birds and related materials.

[34] On January 2, 2025, the CFIA Case Officer assigned to the Applicant's case contacted its principals to introduce herself, provide an overview of the situation, and establish a line of communication to guide them through the multi-step administrative process. Their first interaction was a phone call, during which the principals first raised their theory that the older ostriches may have developed herd immunity because of the unreported 2020 "flu-like" illness, and expressed interest in seeking an exemption from depopulation. The Case Officer explained the exemption application process, emphasized its time-sensitive and document-intensive nature, and highlighted the need to submit a formal "Distinct Unit Request" in a package that the Agency would provide.

[35] Later that same day, the Case Officer sent two follow-up emails. The first email [the Process Introduction Email] was provided three hours following the call. This introductory email included several important attachments: the Notice to Dispose, the Declaration of Infected Place, the Requirement to Quarantine, and a document titled What to Expect - Steps on How CFIA Will Work Through the Process on Your Farm. This last document explained that the entire administrative process of depopulation is "fluid" in that while it consists of well-defined discrete steps, these may overlap in practice. It also detailed the anticipated procedural steps, including discussions with the Case Officer, a lengthy Premises Investigation Questionnaire interview, biocontainment assessment, depopulation, disposal, cleaning and disinfection, and compensation.

[36] The second email [the Exemption Process Overview Email] detailing exemption requirements was sent four hours after the call. It outlined various requirements, including official guidance on exemptions for birds with "rare and valuable genetics," and reiterated that the process is "document heavy." It provided information on how to apply for an exemption from depopulation on this basis. The email reproduced relevant policy content regarding this category of exemption and explained that the assessment is based on both the submission of a completed Distinct Unit Request Package, which was attached to the email, and supporting evidence demonstrating the genetic value of the birds.

[37] Open and frequent communication between the Applicant and CFIA continued after the initial intake process. Following January 2, 2025, communications included virtual meetings, phone calls, emails, and a further on-site inspection. These interactions facilitated discussion and assessment of several key issues, including ostrich immunity, the genetic distinctiveness of the flock, the potential to identify an epidemiologically unexposed subgroup, and the farm's biosecurity conditions.

[38] On January 3, 2025, CFIA officials held a virtual meeting with the Applicant's principals to assist them in completing the Premises Investigation Questionnaire and to gather more information about the property. During the meeting, the son of one principal reported observing a neighbour entering areas already designated as an Infected Place. The Case Officer reminded the Applicant's principals of the importance of managing public perception, noting that their neighbours continued to contact the Agency with concerns about mortality management. The Case Officer emphasized the situation's urgency throughout the meeting, stressing the need for the Applicant to promptly submit evidence supporting their claimed relationship with Kyoto University and the asserted special genetic characteristics of the flock.

[39] On January 7, 2025, CFIA inspectors conducted another site visit at the Applicant's premises, which revealed further concerns with the biosecurity conditions at the farm. Inspectors observed wild ducks following them into the quarantine zone and noted the presence of weasels in the barns. More than 50 wild ducks were seen within one of the ostrich enclosures. Although the Applicant's principals had attempted to fence off a nearby pond, they explained that the wild ducks continued to access the ostrich feed dishes by flying in. The principals also sought guidance from the inspectors on completing the Distinct Unit Request Package. The inspectors reiterated the importance of submitting as much supporting evidence as possible to strengthen their exemption request.

[40] Between January 4 and 9, 2025, the Applicant submitted several documents to support its exemption application while ostrich deaths continued. The main document was the completed Distinct Unit Request Package. Other supporting documents included letters of support, and information detailing its business selling ostrich antibodies and other commercial ventures as support for the Applicant's claim that its ostriches should be exempted for their "rare and valuable genetics" worthy of preservation.

[41] On January 10, 2025, the CFIA issued the Exemption Denial. It concluded that the Applicant had failed to demonstrate the existence of any distinct epidemiological unit free from exposure risk. Additionally, the CFIA found that the Applicant had not submitted sufficient evidence to support its claims of genetic rarity and value qualifying the flock for an exemption.

[42] By mid-January 2025, the spread of illness had reportedly plateaued, although some ostriches remained ill or continued to die. CFIA officials continued to monitor the situation. By the end of January 2025, total ostrich mortalities tied to flu-like illness reportedly reached 69 birds. The Applicant alleges that the last death occurred on January 15, 2025, with the surviving majority appearing healthy or recovered. This reinforced its belief in the flock's attainment of at least partial herd immunity against H5N1.

[43] Late in January 2025, the Applicant requested permission to conduct or arrange additional tests on apparently healthy ostriches to confirm whether they were shedding virus. The Applicant also sought to have recognized genetic experts examine the flock. The record indicates the CFIA did not approve further testing at that stage. It focused instead on the confirmed H5N1-positive test results and reiterated the infection risk associated with an open-air ostrich operation like that of the Applicant's.

# IV. Decisions Below

[44] This judicial review arises from the CFIA's Notice to Dispose and its Exemption Denial. The Notice to Dispose mandates the destruction and disposal of the Applicant's ostriches, while the Exemption Denial refuses the Applicant's request that some or all the birds be spared. Together, these two decisions illustrate the CFIA's position that the Applicant's entire ostrich flock must be culled due to H5N1, with no exemption warranted. The underlying record includes not only the formal instruments themselves, but also supporting documentation such as meeting minutes, telephone call summaries, email correspondence, and internal memoranda. These materials together form the pertinent decision record before this Court.

[45] Before highlighting key aspects of the decision record, it is helpful to situate these decisions within the CFIA's broader administrative process that implements the disposal of animals and things contemplated by subsection 48(1) of the Act. The Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial are two steps in the multi-step process for containing and eradicating the current wave of HPAI, as set out in the 2022 ERP, which operationalizes the Stamping-Out Policy pursuant to the statutory discretion provided by subsection 48(1). The Notice initiates destruction of affected flocks based on established epidemiological criteria. The Exemption Denial serves as a secondary review that evaluates whether specific circumstances justify departing from the primary disease-control protocol.

## A. Notice to Dispose

[46] On December 31, 2024, the CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose requiring destruction of all poultry on the premises. This Agency did this through a Form 4202 Requirement to Dispose of Animals or Things, citing statutory authority under section 48 of the Act. This Order stated that "Avian Influenza" had been "determined or suspected" on the premises and required "all poultry and poultry carcasses along with other material approved by CFIA disposal crew" to be destroyed. The operative period ran from the date of the order to February 1, 2025. The Order treated ostriches as "poultry" for disease-control purposes. At this initial stage, the CFIA did not consider whether any portion of the flock might be exempted.

[47] On January 12, 2025, the CFIA issued an Amended Notice to Dispose, revoking and replacing the initial order of December 31, 2024, to correct several technical details without changing the ordered depopulation. This amendment corrected certain updated quarantine details, primarily the GPS coordinates, while leaving unchanged the substantive requirement to depopulate all ostriches and the original disposal timeline. The amended Order reaffirmed that ostriches fall under the classification of "poultry" for HPAI control purposes and reiterated that all listed animals and items remained subject to destruction. An accompanying explanatory note confirmed that the effective date of the original Notice to Dispose remained December 31, 2024.

[48] Immediately following the issuance of the original Notice to Dispose, the CFIA communicated with the Applicant providing further details regarding movement restrictions, quarantine measures, and the CFIA's avian influenza Stamping-Out Policy. While these additional communications did not add any new formal reasons, they clarified the administrative processes and reinforced the CFIA's position that full flock depopulation was mandatory unless an exemption was explicitly approved. On January 3, 2025, the CFIA Compensation Unit contacted the Applicant to provide information regarding compensation for the ordered destruction of the ostriches pursuant to Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations, SOR/2000-233 [the Compensation Regulations].

## B. Exemption Denial

[49] Following receipt of the Notice to Dispose, the Applicant sought exemption from depopulation claiming, first, that there is a distinct epidemiological unit within its flock that was either unexposed or at reduced risk and, second, that the flock contained "rare and valuable poultry genetics," which warranted preservation from complete depopulation. On January 10, 2025, the CFIA denied both exemption requests. Three sets of documents within the record are particularly significant in illustrating the CFIA's reasoning and decision-making process in evaluating and rejecting the Applicant's exemption request.

[50] The first set of documents consists of the Exemption Process Overview Email with the attached Distinct Unit Request Package, both dated January 2, 2025. This Email from the Case Officer and its attachment detailed the criteria for qualifying as a distinct epidemiological unit and listed the type of supporting documentation required for exemption under the "rare and valuable genetics" category. According to the Email, examples of acceptable documentation included historical records of genetic investment, evidence that the flock consists of high-quality purebred birds, and proof of genomic testing for specific traits.

[51] These documents were sent shortly after the Case Officer's initial intake phone call with the Applicant's principals, during which the principals expressed interest in seeking an exemption. In the Exemption Process Overview Email, the Case Officer invited the Applicant to submit supporting documentation for the exemption request, characterizing the application process as "document heavy." The Email reads:

Hello Again,
Sorry for the multiple emails!
This process is document heavy, but I'm here to help you navigate the process!

Based on the information we've gathered, you fall into the "birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics" category. I've copied CFIA's description here:

Rare and valuable genetics in poultry refers to uncommon genetic lines of poultry that hold a high economic value. Genetic breeding of poultry involves the creation of multi-generation genetically diverse populations on which selection is practiced to create adapted animals with new combinations of specific desirable traits. It is this combination of an uncommon breed or line of poultry, which undergoes a selection process to create specific desirable traits which leads to its high economic value.

# 3.1 Initial screening to classify birds as having rare and valuable genetics

The genetics of the flock can be demonstrated to be distinctive from standard commercial flocks with criteria such as but not limited to the following:

- There is historical evidence of genetic investment (e.g. breeding books, use of closed flocks of breeding pure line birds for a prolonged period, a selection program from trained geneticists is implemented);

- The flock consists of high quality pure-bred birds (e.g. are recognized by breed associations, 3rd party national/international organizations or by the poultry industry as top producers/prized genetics/suppliers of genetics);
- Genomics testing for specific traits has been undertaken

Here's what we need from you at this time to get started:

- We need documented proof that these birds are distinctive from standard commercial flocks. The highlighted section above gives good examples of the types of documents we're looking for.
- If you have any documentation of the agreement between you and the university - that'd be really helpful to send to us.
- I'll also need you guys to fill out the attached document Distinct Unit Package that will need to be completed and sent back to me.

Thanks,
[bold and italic in the original]

[52] The second set of documents comprises the Applicant's submissions supporting their exemption request. These documents, submitted to the CFIA Case Officer between January 2 and 10, 2025, included business plans highlighting research into ostrich antibodies, the potential commercialization of specific genetic lines, and assertions about the flock's unique African genetic heritage. They also contained diagrams illustrating the farm's physical layout, depicting fenced partitions and a large central natural pond, as well as letters from collaborators affirming the distinctiveness and commercial or research value of the flock.

[53] The third set of documents consists of the CFIA's formal communication of the denial and reasoning. This includes the Case Officer's January 10, 2025, email communicating the denial, the attached Response Letter providing formal reasons, and an Internal Recommendation Memorandum that formalized internal decision-making discussions. The email acknowledged the emotional distress that the Applicant's principals may experience and offered follow-up discussion opportunities with CFIA officials. The attached Response Letter explained that ostriches are "poultry" under its existing policy and the WOAH definitions, that selective disposal of birds would conflict with Canada's Stamping-Out obligations, and that the evidence did not satisfy the distinct epidemiological unit exemption threshold and the criteria for the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption. It concluded: "This decision is final and is not subject to appeal" [emphasis in the original].

[54] Informing the Exemption Denial was the Internal Recommendation Memorandum prepared and reviewed by the Exemption Committee. This Memorandum forms part of the Exemption Denial decision, as administrative decision-makers are entitled to adopt the reasoning of recommending bodies, such as the Exemption Committee, with the adopted reasoning being treated as that of the decision-makers: Canada (Attorney General) v Sketchley, 2005 FCA 404 at para 37-39.

[55] The Exemption Committee reviewed the Applicant's submissions and the Agency's internal policies and concluded there was "no evidence of a subset of birds existing as a distinct unit or at a different level of risk." This finding was based on site visits and documentation confirming that the Applicant's ostriches roamed outdoors across multiple pens, shared feed and staff, and frequently interacted with wild birds attracted to the central pond. Given the open layout of the farm, the shared equipment and staff, and the uniform risk of H5N1 transmission, the Committee concluded it was impractical to subdivide the flock for biosafety purposes, finding no distinct epidemiological units that could qualify for exemption.

[56] The Committee also determined that the Applicant failed to show the genetic uniqueness or economic value of the flock. The Exemption Committee highlighted that the Applicant had "a significant burden of proof... to demonstrate the high economic value the flock provides to the broader Canadian poultry industry" and the nature of the "robust processes ... to actively select and breed for specific desirable traits." The Committee concluded that the Applicant had not met either requirement based on the evidence it had provided. Additionally, the Committee conducted an analysis on trade implications of non-adoption or non-implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy and wrote about a preliminary scientific literature review indicating that ostriches can harbour and spread sub-clinical H5N1 and potentially facilitate further viral mutations and reassortments.

[57] Collectively, these documents articulate this rationale: ostriches, classified as poultry under Canadian avian influenza control policies, must be destroyed pursuant to the WOAHsupported Stamping-Out Policy upon confirmation of HPAI infection unless strict exemption criteria are met. Based on this rationale, the CFIA determined the Applicant's flock was uniformly exposed to risk and concluded the Applicant failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the exemption criteria.

## C. Injunction

[58] The Applicant filed a motion to enjoin the CFIA from enforcing the Notice to Dispose and the Requirement to Quarantine. By Order dated January 31, 2025, this Court stayed the Notice to Dispose "until a decision is rendered in the underlying application for judicial review." The Requirement to Quarantine was left untouched.

# V. Issues

[59] The Applicant identifies five issues in their written submissions:

1) The applicable standard of review;
2) Whether the CFIA properly exercised its discretion in issuing the Notice to Dispose;
3) Whether the CFIA breached procedural fairness in making the Exemption Denial;
4) Whether the CFIA properly applied its own exemption criteria; and
5) Whether the CFIA properly exercised its discretion in issuing the Exemption Denial.

[60] At the hearing, the Applicant raised two novel issues, both bearing on the reasonableness of the CFIA's implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy in the Applicant's specific circumstances. First, whether the CFIA relied on an incorrect factual assumption about the pathogenicity of the virus in deciding to apply the Policy. Second, whether the CFIA's classification of the farm's ostriches as "poultry" was incorrect and, if so, whether that misclassification rendered its application of the Policy unreasonable.

[61] The Respondent proposes a different three-part framing of the issues:

1) Should portions of the five expert reports filed by the Applicant be struck;
2) Was the Notice reasonable and issued in a procedurally fair manner; and
3) Was the Exemption Refusal reasonable and made in a procedurally fair manner.

[62] Although neither party's framing fully captures the scope and complexity of the issues in this judicial review, I find two submissions made by the Respondent's counsel at the hearing particularly helpful in structuring the analysis. First, the Respondent correctly points out that the Applicant devotes significant attention to challenging the reasonableness of the Stamping-Out Policy itself. Hence, addressing the reasonableness of the Policy as a distinct issue yields a clearer and more logical analysis. Second, the Respondent's conceptual distinction between the formulation and implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy strikes at the heart of this case. Treating these as distinct parts to be analyzed, each subject to different contextual factors and judicial review considerations, provides a more coherent and analytically sound framework.

[63] Accordingly, this Court frames the issues as follows:

1. Whether the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy, as currently operationalized through the 2022 ERP policy document, is reasonable in law?
2. Whether the CFIA's implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy was reasonable and procedurally fair given the Applicant's specific circumstances?
   2.1. Whether the Notice to Dispose was made through a fair process, unfettered, and reasonable?
   2.2. Whether the Exemption Denial was made through a fair process and reasonable?

[64] Finally, this Court also needs to address several evidentiary objections raised by both parties. These include admissibility and weight to be afforded to portions of each other's expert reports, certain challenged parts of the affidavit of Dr. Cathy Furness submitted by the Respondent, and the challenge to the reliability of the Respondent's Report of Inspector, authored and signed by Inspector Dykstra on January 31, 2025.

# VI. Standard of Review

## A. The fundamentals

[65] The parties submit that the applicable standard for review of procedural fairness is correctness. However, based on the jurisprudence, I find a more accurate characterization to be one that resembles the correctness standard but shifts the focus from determining the correct procedure to assessing "whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances": Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 [Canadian Pacific] at para 54; Heiltsuk Horizon Maritime Services Ltd v Atlantic Towing Limited, 2021 FCA 26 at para 107. The goal of the procedural fairness review should always be investigating "the ultimate question [of] whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond": Canadian Pacific at para 56.

[66] For substantive review, I agree with the parties that the CFIA's decisions to issue the Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness, as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Vavilov.

[67] Reasonableness review is one single deferential yet robust standard: Vavilov at paras 12-13 and 89. The Court must give considerable deference to the decision-maker, recognizing that this entity is empowered by Parliament and equipped with specialized knowledge and understanding of the "purposes and practical realities of the relevant administrative regime" and "consequences and the operational impact of the decision" that the reviewing court may not be attentive towards: Vavilov at para 93. Judicial intervention is warranted only when the flaws or shortcomings are "sufficiently serious... such that [the decision] cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency:" Vavilov at para 100. Absent exceptional circumstances, reviewing courts must not interfere with the decision maker's factual findings and cannot reweigh and reassess evidence considered by the decision-maker: Vavilov at para 125.

[68] However, reasonableness review is not a mere "rubber-stamping" process: Vavilov at para 13. It is the reviewing court's task to assess whether the decision as a whole is reasonable; that is, it is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision-maker: Vavilov at para 85.

[69] A court conducting reasonableness review is not, and must not become, an "academy of science": Coldwater First Nation v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 34 [Coldwater First Nation] at para 119; Inverhuron \& District Ratepayers Ass. v Canada (Minister of The Environment), 2001 FCA 203 [Inverhuron] at para 40. When conducting reasonableness review of decisions involving highly scientific and technical subject matters, courts must pay careful attention to the decision-maker's expertise: Vavilov at paras 92 and 93. This expertise warrants judicial deference in the assessment of facts: Vavilov at para 125; Safe Food Matters Inc. v Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 1471 [Safe Food Matters] at para 121; Dias v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 126 at para 8. Similarly, deference is also warranted in the interpretation of law, particularly when it pertains to the decision-maker's home statutes: Safe Food Matters at paras 8 and 111; Balogh v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 447 at para 18. However, such expertise must be demonstrated by the decision-makers for the judiciary to afford it deference: Vavilov at para 93; Mason v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at para 70.

[70] In addition to considering the administrative decision-maker's demonstrated expertise, the relevant evidentiary record, and the applicable legal framework, reviewing courts must also pay attention to the impact of the decision on those affected by its consequences. This dimension of judicial scrutiny has been brought to the forefront of reasonableness review by the Supreme Court in paragraphs 133 to 135 of Vavilov: "concerns regarding arbitrariness will generally be more acute in cases where the consequences of the decision for the affected party are particularly severe or harsh, and a failure to grapple with such consequences may well be unreasonable."

## B. Reasonableness review of policy decisions

[71] The context of administrative decisions shapes what constitutes reasonable decision-making, even though it does not alter the standard of review itself. As established in Vavilov at paragraph 89, although context does "not modulate the standard or the degree of scrutiny by the reviewing court," it does "constrain [...] what will be reasonable for an administrative decision maker to decide in a given case." This distinction means that while courts must apply consistent analytical rigour for judicial reviews of all administrative decisions, the outcomes of a reasonableness review will necessarily vary depending on the decision-making context, with "some decisions [being] more likely to survive reasonableness review because they are relatively unconstrained," while "other decisions may be less likely to survive because they are relatively more constrained": Entertainment Software Association v Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2020 FCA 100 [Entertainment Software] at para 25.

[72] Policy decisions fall into the "very much unconstrained" category and therefore are "harder to set aside": Entertainment Software at paras 24-28 and 31. They typically require balancing of complex social, scientific, economic, and public interest considerations, which are better left for the executive branch of the government and its various administrative arms. This is particularly true for policy decisions establishing general frameworks "without reference to particular cases," as they are even less adjudicative and administrative in nature. Importantly, courts should not recast such decisions as administrative acts merely because certain actors may experience a sharper economic impact than others: South Shore Trading Co. Ltd. v Canada (Fisheries, Oceans and Coast Guard), 2025 FC 174 [South Shore] at paras 44-48.

[73] Historically, judicial intervention in policy decisions has been limited to specific, narrow grounds. Precedents such as Maple Lodge Farms v Government of Canada, [1982] 2 SCR 2 [Maple Lodge Farm], have established that courts may interfere only where the policy is tainted by bad faith, breaches an express requirement of statutory natural justice, or relies on considerations that are "irrelevant or extraneous" to the statute's purpose: South Shore at para 50, citing Maple Lodge Farms at pp 7-8.

[74] The Supreme Court of Canada has now folded these traditional grounds for intervention into Vavilov's unified reasonableness framework. In Auer v. Auer, 2024 SCC 36 [Auer], the Supreme Court established that subordinate legislation, such as regulations, is presumptively reviewed for reasonableness. The "irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated" test from Katz Group Canada Inc. v Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, now functions merely as a reminder that subordinate rules must remain within the enabling statute's boundaries, rather than as a separate threshold distinct from Vavilov's framework: Auer at paras 29-36, 41-47 and 50-65. At paragraphs 59 to 65 of Auer, the Supreme Court stressed that "the governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law and the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant constraints" under reasonableness review. The central question for reviewing courts is whether the impugned instrument can plausibly be located within the purpose, text, and overall architecture of the enabling statute. Weighing the substantive merits of policymaking is strictly off limits: Auer at paras 55-58.

[75] Although Auer addressed specifically decisions to make subordinate legislation, its reasoning logically extends to policymaking decisions. The key connective tissue is the source of authority: in both contexts, the decision-maker exercises broad, delegated discretionary power to pursue legislative objectives. Vavilov has identified the governing statute, other relevant law, and factual context as the "legal and factual constraints" on every administrative act: Vavilov at paras 105-135. Therefore, whether discretion manifests through formal regulations or through general policy directives, administrative decision-makers must always interpret their enabling provisions purposively, act within statutory boundaries, and demonstrate that their legislative or quasi-legislative actions advance the statutory objectives given the available legal and factual constraints.

[76] Consequently, the core reasonableness review considerations articulated in Auer should also apply to policymaking decisions. The analytical framework should not turn on the formal label of "regulation." What matters most is the nature of the decision itself. Specifically, whether it creates generally applicable rules on statutory authority to be applied by more frontline decision-makers in the administrative decision-making chain. This description encompasses ministerial directives, Cabinet guidelines, and disease-control policies no less than regulations. Accordingly, the analytical framework in Auer that includes the principles of presumption of validity, purposive interpretation, and prohibition on merits review should also guide courts reviewing any policymaking decision. Ultimately, the inquiry remains whether the decision to adopt the policy instrument is grounded in a rational, purposive interpretation of the enabling statute and respects all relevant procedural, substantive, and contextual limits.

[77] Deference is particularly warranted for policy decisions intended to safeguard animal and public health from high-risk disease. Case law has shown this principle consistently. In Kohl v Canada (Department of Agriculture), [1995] FCJ No. 1076 (FCA) [Kohl], the Federal Court of Appeal described a ministerial order made under section 48 of the Act as a "policy decision obviously not subject to the requirements of the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness," reviewable solely for abuse or misuse of power: Kohl at para 18.

[78] The teaching from Kohl is clear. Where a policy decision ordering blanket disposal of affected animals and things is made in good faith, reviewing courts should confine their reasonableness analysis to whether the destruction advances the objectives of the Act and whether there is some evidence to support the underlying suspicion. Following Vavilov, the threshold for finding sufficient support today is undoubtedly reasonableness, meaning the question is whether the suspicion is reasonably supported by the evidence and consistent with applicable legal constraints. Substituting a different view of the scientific and operational determinations underlying the policy decision would risk treading on the executive's policy prerogative: Kohl at paras 20-22.

[79] Entertainment Software, South Shore, Kohl and Auer converge into a single guiding principle: courts serve as guardians of legality, not arbiters of the wisdom of policy. When the legislature explicitly delegates public interest decisions, such as the management of animal and public health, to administrative actors, courts must leave assessment of policy merits, especially the nuanced balancing of scientific, economic, and social factors, to decision-makers tasked by Parliament with those responsibilities. Judicial review of policy decisions should only target compliance with legal and factual constraints, and verification of whether the alleged exercise of technical expertise in formulating the policy decisions has been sufficiently demonstrated.

# VII. Legal Framework

## A. The law and policy on disposal of affected or contaminated animals and things

### (1) The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme

[80] Under the Act, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food [the Minister] holds significant powers to manage diseases in animals. These powers advance the Act's core objectives by proactively preventing and controlling animal diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans, thereby protecting public health and preserving Canada's international trade status: River Valley Poultry Farm Ltd v Canada (Attorney General), 2009 ONCA 326 [River Valley Poultry Farm] at para 68; Paradis Honey Ltd v Canada (Agriculture and Agri-Food), 2024 FC 1921 [Paradis Honey] at para 23; Jerram v Canada (Minister of Agriculture) (T.D.), [1994] 3 FC 17 [Jerram] at para 30; Kohl at paras 7-12.

[81] The Act provides multiple tools for containing disease outbreaks, including infected place declarations, quarantines, and control zones. The Minister and their delegates have authority to declare infected places under sections 22 to 23, impose quarantines per section 25, and establish primary control zones pursuant to section 27. These declarations trigger strict prohibitions against the movement of animals or related items within or out of affected areas without a licence to facilitate swift containment of potential outbreaks. Notably, Parliament has anticipated the need for broad and proactive containment measures. As such, under subsection 22(2), control orders automatically extend not only to directly affected premises but also to adjacent lands, buildings, or properties owned or occupied by the same individual.

[82] Central to this judicial review is section 48 of the Act. Subsection 48(1) empowers the Minister and their delegates to order the destruction of animals or things in three scenarios: (a) if the animal is infected, suspected of infection, or contaminated by a disease or toxic substance; (b) if the animal has been in contact with or in proximity to an infected animal or thing; or (c) if the animal itself is a vector, causative agent, or toxic substance. Enforcement is governed by subsection 48(3), which mandates a written "Notice to Dispose" specifying the timeline and method of destruction. Compliance is compulsory, as failure to act permits authorities to directly dispose of the animals. Subsection 48(2) offers an alternative to destruction, allowing treatment instead, but only where the Minister is satisfied that treatment will "eliminate or prevent the spread" of the disease or toxic substance.

[83] Parliament has clearly conferred broad discretion on the Minister and their delegates under section 48 of the Act. The Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that even a mere suspicion of exposure, without confirmed contamination, is sufficient to justify issuing a Notice to Dispose under the Act: Kohl at para 20. This broad latitude is also reflected in Parliament's use of the permissive language "may." However, this discretion is limited to a functional binary of destruction and treatment. Within this framework, the discretion focuses on two key decisions: (1) whether to order destruction or authorize treatment; and (2) how to carry out the chosen course of action. The statute leaves no room for a third "wait-and-see" approach. Interpreting section 48 to allow for such an option would violate the "well established principle of statutory interpretation that the legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences," which include situations where an interpretation "is incompatible with other provisions or with the object of the legislative enactment": Rizzo \& Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 SCR 27 at para 27. Given the Act's objectives of proactive disease prevention and control, a "wait-and-see" approach, unless it can be reasonably nested under a destruction or treatment plan, would undermine those core mandates and result in precisely the kind of incompatible interpretation the law forbids.

[84] Moreover, discretion under the treatment option is narrowly circumscribed by scientific and operational realities. Subsection 48(2) explicitly limits treatment to situations "where the Minister considers that the treatment will be effective in eliminating or preventing" the spread of disease. This means that the Minister and their delegates' discretion to authorize treatment is therefore limited by scientific and operational realities: they must have confidence that treatment is both scientifically viable and practically feasible. Consequently, where the Minister and their delegates determine that treatment provided by subsection 48(2) of the Act cannot reliably eradicate or prevent the spread of a high-risk disease, the Act effectively compels the ordering of destruction contemplated by subsection 48(1).

[85] Recognizing that the CFIA's mandate is protective rather than punitive, the Act also balances depopulation requirements with compensation to affected animal owners. Specifically, under subsection 51(1) of the Act, owners whose animals are destroyed or die after being required to be destroyed are entitled to compensation calculated based on the animal's market value prior to destruction, less any residual value in the carcasses. Nevertheless, this market valuation is subject to regulatory caps provided by the Compensation Regulations. Specifically, pursuant to subsection 2(a) and the associated Schedule, compensation for an ostrich is limited to a maximum of $3,000 per animal. The compensation framework also extends beyond the value of the animals themselves. Subsection 51(4) of the Act permits additional compensation for disposal-related costs, which, as specified by subsection 3(1) of the Compensation Regulations, may include reasonable costs of transportation, slaughter, cleaning and disinfection, disposal services, and personal labour expended by the owner.

[86] Importantly, this compensation scheme is no-fault in nature and tied to compliance with CFIA directives. Compensation becomes payable after destruction pursuant to section 48 of the Act. In this way, the framework encourages timely cooperation with the Agency's disease control measures while recognizing the significant economic impact borne by owners whose flocks must be sacrificed in the interest of protecting the broader public good.

### (2) The Jurisprudence on the Act's Objective and the Decision-Maker's Discretion

[87] This Court has long recognized that, when faced with urgent threats to animal health, public safety, or economic interests, the Minister and their delegates are entitled to adopt drastic measures that may seriously and adversely impact individuals affected by the decision, particularly in economic terms. As Justice Cullen recognized in David Hunt Farms Ltd v Canada (Minister of Agriculture), 1994 CarswellNat 1859 (FC TD) [David Hunt FC] at para 51, the authorities may legitimately pursue an "admittedly draconian approach," provided it is pursued in good faith and for legitimate public-interest objectives. In such circumstances, the broader public interest in disease-control prevails over individual property rights, especially given the statutory compensation mechanisms available under section 51 of the Act: David Hunt FC at para 52.

[88] The jurisprudence further makes clear that the Minister's discretion under subsection 48(1) includes the power to develop general policy directives, the implementation of which is delegated to subordinate officials: David Hunt FC at para 43, aff'd David Hunt Farms Ltd v Canada (Minister of Agriculture), 1994 CarswellNat 1876 (FCA) [David Hunt FCA] at paras 4-5, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused [1994] SCCA No. 353; Carpenter Fishing Corp. v. Canada, [1997] FCJ No 1811 (FCA) [Carpenter Fishing] at paras 28-29. This principle reflects the recognized distinction between two types of discretion under the Act: a broad discretion involving the formulation of general policy, and a constrained discretion exercised by officials responsible for implementing that policy.

[89] This distinction gives rise to a two-phase framework for understanding the exercise of discretion under subsection 48(1). In the first phase, at the ministerial level, the Minister exercises broad discretion to formulate general policies governing the control of animal diseases. As Justice Cullen noted in paragraph 43 of David Hunt FC, "section 48(1) vests the discretion to require the disposal of animals in the Minister, not in a person such as an inspector, or a District Veterinarian." In the second phase, at the administrative level, frontline officials implement the policies established by the Minister, typically exercising little to no independent discretion. This division mirrors the approach identified by the Federal Court of Appeal in Carpenter Fishing at paragraph 28, where the Court explicitly distinguished between "the imposition of a quota policy" as "a discretionary decision in the nature of policy or legislative action" and "the granting of a specific license" as an administrative action.

[90] This two-phase structure aligns with established administrative law principles and ensures operational feasibility. The structure conforms with principles distinguishing between the more permissible delegation of administrative tasks and the more problematic delegation of quasi-legislative or judicial functions: The Queen v Harrison, [1977] 1 SCR 238 at p 245; Re Peralta and the Queen, [1985] OJ No 2304 at paras 63-73; The Dene Nation v The Queen, [1984] 2 FC 942 at p 947. Practically, requiring the Minister to personally make every decision concerning animal health across the country would be unworkable and inconsistent with the need for an efficient and effective animal disease response system. By allowing the Minister and their delegates to set general policy and entrust its routine implementation to officials, the two-phased statutory scheme promotes operational feasibility and consistency in a large tribunal like the Agency, which exercises discretionary powers with significant consequences for Canadians: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Thamotharem, 2007 FCA 198 [Thamotharem] at para 60. As the case law recognizes, the adoption and application of general policies are both permissible and desirable, provided such policies are not applied blindly and the decision-maker remains attentive to specific circumstances: Carpenter Fishing at para 29.

[91] The distinction between policy formulation and implementation has real impacts on judicial review. First, reviewing courts must carefully differentiate between the review of general policy decisions, which are more quasi-legislative in nature, and the review of specific decisions implementing those policies, which are more administrative in nature. As the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized in Carpenter Fishing at paragraph 29, courts must not apply the standards of review appropriate to administrative decisions when assessing legislative policymaking. The Federal Court of Appeal further instructed that, where a challenge to an administrative decision indirectly attacks an underlying policy, courts should isolate the policy component and apply standards appropriate to legislative action. Consequently, courts afford greater deference to general policy decisions, while applying more rigorous scrutiny to their specific administrative application.

[92] Second, the obligations of procedural fairness also vary depending on whether the exercise of administrative discretion involves general policy formulation or specific administrative implementation. Decisions grounded in high-level policy formulation, especially at ministerial or institutional levels, and aimed explicitly at the public interest typically trigger minimal procedural protections for individuals, with the generally viable route being challenges on grounds of abuse of discretion: David Hunt FC at para 52, citing Martineau v Matsqui Disciplinary Board, [1980] 1 SCR 602 at 628-629; Kohl at paras 19-21. In contrast, decisions that are "not of a legislative nature," delegated to frontline officials, and directly "affect[ing] the rights, privileges, or interests of an individual," attract heightened procedural fairness obligations: Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, [1985] 2 SCR 643 [Cardinal] at para 14; Knight v Indian Head School Division No. 19, [1990] 1 SCR 653 at p. 670; Blois v. Onion Lake Cree Nation, 2020 FC 953 at para 69.

### (3) The "Stamping-Out" Policy

#### (a) Overview

[93] The Stamping-Out Policy is Canada's adaptation of internationally recognized and applied principles for managing HPAI outbreaks. It prioritizes swift elimination of infected populations rather than individual testing and disposal of affected animals. Adopted during and developed following Canada's first HPAI outbreak in British Columbia in 2004, the Policy aligns with three sequential steps of the stamping-out approach outlined by the World Organisation for Animal Health, Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Paris: WOAH, 2024) [Terrestrial Code]: killing affected animals and those suspected of exposure, disposing of carcasses, and cleansing and disinfecting establishments. Rather than prescribing detailed operational procedures, the Stamping-Out Policy sets only high-level guidance, with specific implementation protocols developed through instruments that translate the broader Policy into individual processes and actionable steps at the field level. This approach has been maintained as a directive of general applicability across different outbreak scenarios, with implementation triggered by specific conditions. Currently, the trigger is defined in the 2022 ERP as laboratory confirmation of H5-subtype HPAI detection in domestic birds within a defined epidemiological unit.

[94] Since its inception, the Stamping-Out Policy has been consistently implemented by the CFIA as its primary strategy for managing HPAI outbreaks. Previously formalized in the 2007 and 2013 Notifiable Avian Influenza Hazard-Specific Plans [the NAI HSPs] and now operationalized through the 2022 ERP, the Policy has been found by the Agency to be the most successful method for eradicating viruses, eliminating environmental contamination, halting transmission, and reducing public health risks. The 2022 ERP sets out a flexible set of guidelines informed by past decisions, and is intended to: 1) cover situations not addressed by an existing policy; 2) allow deviation from or modification of an existing policy; 3) clarify existing policy; or 4) provide a range of adaptable policy options in varying decision-making contexts. Along with other guidelines, this instrument is regularly refined and amended, particularly when sufficiently unique situations necessitate more tailored response mechanisms.

[95] The Stamping-Out Policy's legal foundation rests in both subsection 48(1) of the Act and the long-established administrative law principle that agencies may use "soft law" instruments to guide the exercise of their discretion without requiring an express statutory mandate: Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2020 FCA 196 at para 45, citing Thamotharem at para 56. Scientifically and operationally, the Policy is informed by international standards, particularly those set by WOAH, and by scientific research and practical considerations tailored to Canada's agricultural, biosafety, and economic realities. Canada's international commitments and trade agreements also guide the design of the Stamping-Out Policy. They also further reinforce and incentivize the consistent domestic application of the Policy to protect its international reputation and maintain market access.

[96] The Stamping-Out Policy operates as an automatic response protocol once triggered, with discretion reserved for exemptions. The overall process of administering the Policy is multistepped. In practice, the very first step of exercising discretion granted under subsection 48(1) to decide whether to destroy or to treat HPAI-infected animals has already been done at the stage when the CFIA, as a delegate of the Minister, decided to develop and adopt the Stamping-Out Policy. As a result, once a triggering laboratory result arises, the Policy functions more as an automatic response protocol rather than an occasion for fresh discretionary judgment. At that point, the roles of relevant CFIA officials are to implement the established procedures for the depopulation and destruction of animals and things, not to decide anew how to respond. As part of this process, the CFIA must define the epidemiological unit, which by default encompasses birds on the entire premises unless scientific evidence justifies a narrower designation. Once such unit is determined, all remaining steps follow according to the prescribed protocol: depopulation, disposal, and disinfection of the entire unit, along with the surveillance periods consistent with WOAH standards. Discretion remains available, however, through the exemption process, where the CFIA evaluates on a case-by-case basis whether certain birds can be exempted under one of three narrow categories.

[97] This predominantly automatic approach, with discretion reserved for case-specific exemptions, reflects the scientific and operational realities of managing HPAI outbreaks: to counteract a virus with high transmissibility, capacity for rapid spread prior to visible clinical symptoms, and potential to seriously harm Canada's animal health, human health, and international trade interests. This unique decision-making context drives the Stamping-Out Policy's prioritization of immediate containment and depopulation to prevent further spread. It also explains why both Parliament and the judiciary have consistently endorsed the proactive, preventive philosophy underpinning both the Act and the relevant jurisprudence such as the David Hunt cases, Kohl, Paradis Honey, and River Valley Poultry Farm.

#### (b) International Obligations and Trade Implications

[98] The adoption and operationalization of the Stamping-Out Policy reflects Canada's commitment to fulfill binding international obligations, rather than mere domestic policy preference. Annex A(3)(b) of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures has designated the WOAH as the authoritative international standard-setting body for animal health. Unsurprisingly, Canada's major trade agreements, including Article 9.6 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement and Chapter 5 of the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, explicitly incorporate selected WOAH standards and condition market access to Canada's trading partners on demonstrated compliance with specific WOAH protocols.

[99] Non-compliance with the Stamping-Out Policy can cause severe national economic consequences through extended trade restrictions in at least two ways. First, Article 10.4.3 of the Terrestrial Code establishes dramatically different waiting periods for regaining HPAI-free status: only 28 days after completing stamping-out and disinfection, versus a minimum of 12 months if stamping-out is not implemented. If the Policy is not adopted or observed, this extended trade restriction period can devastate not just individual farming operations but potentially a significant portion of Canada's agricultural export sector.

[100] Second, proper adoption and observation of the Stamping-Out Policy are the bedrocks of Canada's negotiated regional containment zoning agreements, which limit trade impacts to specific geographical areas during outbreaks while allowing exports to continue from unaffected regions. Dr. Suminder Sawhney, Senior Director of Animal Import and Export at CFIA, confirms that deviations from the Policy, even for smaller-scale outbreaks involving uncommon species, could invalidate entire agreements. The resulting comprehensive trade bans could impose economic costs far exceeding the immediate costs of containing individual outbreaks and harm the broader Canadian poultry industry, not just the affected premises.

#### (c) Operationalization through the 2022 ERP: Trigger and Implementation

[101] The 2022 ERP is the latest instrument that operationalizes the Stamping-Out Policy. Section 7.1 of the 2022 ERP sets out the triggering mechanism for implementing the Stamping-Out Policy, which varies depending on whether the case is the first occurrence, known as an index case, in a province or a subsequent detection in the same province. For an index case, the policy requires both H5 detection and pathotyping confirmation of the level of pathogenicity at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg. For any subsequent cases within the same province, any H5 RRT-PCR positive result from a Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network approved laboratory immediately activates the Policy without requiring pathotyping.

[102] When triggered, the Policy applies uniformly to all domestic birds susceptible to avian influenza, regardless of species characteristics. Section 7.3 of the 2022 ERP states: "The classification of an IP [Infected Premises] as non-poultry does not change the eradication actions required on the IP. These will be the same as for an IP classified as non-commercial (small holding) poultry." While the 2022 ERP does distinguish between "Commercial poultry," "Non-commercial poultry," and "Non-poultry," these classifications of Infected Premises affect only trade reporting, zoning requirements, and surveillance protocols. They do not alter the fundamental eradication measures applied to the premises itself. As section 7.6 of the 2022 ERP confirms, "Regardless of the classification of an IP (7.3), individual IP actions include application of stamping out measures." Susceptibility to avian influenza - not size, commercial value, rarity, or expected lifespan - is the sole determining factor for whether a particular species falls within the Policy's scope. Consequently, all susceptible birds - from common farm species like chickens and turkeys to less frequently domesticated birds like emus and ostriches - face the same depopulation protocol when H5 or H7 is detected in an epidemiological unit.

[103] Critical to proper implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy is the determination of the "epidemiological unit," which the 2022 ERP defines in Section 7.2 as: "A group of animals with the same likelihood of exposure to the pathogenic agent." By default, this encompasses the entire premises, unless evidence demonstrates that smaller units maintain physical and functional separation. In essence, this determination of an epidemiological unit represents a scientific assessment of exposure risk, not individual animal infection status. Once the CFIA defines the unit, every bird within it must be destroyed, except for three strictly defined exemption categories, and the environment must undergo the depopulation, disposal, and disinfection measures prescribed in the 2022 ERP Sections 7.6 through 7.8.

[104] Once triggered, the Stamping-Out Policy mandates a structured sequence of three operational phases that closely mirror those described by the Terrestrial Code. Sections 7.6 to 7.8 of the 2022 ERP outline these steps. First, depopulation requires humanely destroying all birds in the identified epidemiological unit using CFIA-approved methods. Second, disposal requires securely eliminating all carcasses and contaminated materials through biosecure methods that prevent environmental contamination. Third, premises must undergo primary cleaning and disinfection or, where infeasible, an extended 120-day fallow period at temperatures below 4°C for natural viral inactivation. These steps progress through a structured sequence: 1) completing the destruction phase permits disposal operations; 2) properly disposing of carcasses reduces airborne risk sufficiently to allow bird placement outside infected premises and begins a 14-day surveillance period in the surrounding control zone; 3) finishing the cleaning and disinfection phase triggers duty to notify WOAH of outbreak closure and initiates a 28-day surveillance period in the broader control area; and 4) either a 14-day post-cleaning vacancy period or 120-day fallow period permits lifting all restrictions and quarantine orders.

#### (d) Exemption Framework and Assessment Criteria

[105] The 2022 ERP permits three narrow exemptions from depopulation required by the Stamping-Out Policy under specific scientifically defensible circumstances: "distinct units," "rare and valuable genetics," and "pet birds." Conceptually speaking, this exemption does not constitute a detachment of the birds in question from the Policy itself, but rather excludes said birds from the epidemiological unit to which depopulation must be applied. Pursuant to sections 7.2.1 and 7.6 as well as the Exemptions from depopulation appendix of the 2022 ERP, these exemptions all share a common threshold requirement: the birds must constitute a distinct epidemiological unit with no exposure to the virus.

[106] In addition to the basic requirement of a distinct epidemiological unit, each of the three exemption categories also has specific qualifying criteria. For "distinct units," a portion of an infected premises may qualify for exemption if it maintains both physical and functional separation from the rest of the premises. This requires demonstrating separation through factors such as dedicated ventilation systems, physical barriers, separate staff, and biosecurity protocols preventing cross-contamination. For "rare and valuable genetics," poultry lines must demonstrate high economic or genetic value and maintain status as a distinct epidemiological unit. For "pet birds," exemptions may apply where birds are kept indoors, remain clinically healthy, and form a distinct epidemiological unit separate from the exposed population.

[107] A brief clarification is warranted to avoid confusion of the similarly named terms of "distinct unit" and "distinct epidemiological unit." While closely related, these terms are not interchangeable, and thus have important differences in application. Unlike "distinct unit," which typically requires physical and infrastructural separation, "distinct epidemiological unit" turns on demonstrated epidemiological independence. This can be shown through strict health monitoring, assigned staff, and rigorous biosecurity protocols that prevent exposure to the pathogen. In practice, however, achieving this level of epidemiological independence will often require many of the same physical and functional separations associated with a "distinct unit."

[108] Assessment of exemption requests follows a rigorous, evidence-based, and discretionary process. Interdisciplinary committees like the Exemption Committee evaluate applications filled out by applicants against twenty distinct criteria related to physical separation, operational biosecurity, and risk management. As indicated on the self-assessment questionnaire in the Distinct Unit Request Package itself, any "NO" answers to these criteria likely precludes exemption. Additionally, the committees also weigh international trade and public health implications before granting an exemption. Furthermore, any exemption granted is automatically void if subsequent testing detects infection in the exempted birds, triggering the immediate application of the full Stamping-Out Policy to the previously exempted birds.

[109] The CFIA has strictly observed this distinct epidemiological unit threshold requirement in its evaluation of exemption applications. To date, it has granted only one exemption during the current outbreak: a March 2022 decision on a turkey production facility [the March 2022 Exemption]. In that case, CFIA ordered the destruction of turkeys in only two barns, while sparing those in other barns on the same premises. This limited exemption was justified by multiple biosafety measures establishing demonstrated epidemiological separation: 1) each grow-out barn maintained "distinct/separate air space in regards to ventilation"; 2) the facility implemented "various biosecurity measures...to mitigate the risk of transmission between other flocks/barns," including "shower in/shower out procedures, dedicated clothing, footwear, equipment"; and 3) "official CFIA control mechanisms... have been placed on the premise." Only after establishing the existence of a distinct epidemiological unit did the CFIA proceed to evaluate whether the facility qualified for the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption. It concluded that the spared turkeys met this criterion, as they were "high value pedigree birds that are the genetic cornerstone for the further production of commercial turkeys."

## B. The law on fettering

[110] Fettering is a serious flaw in administrative decision-making. It unlawfully removes or abandons the discretion that legislatures intended to be exercised in relation to individual cases: Vavilov at para 108, citing Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Lukács, 2018 SCC 2 at para 18. Fettering occurs when decision-makers blindly follow soft law instruments as if they were binding law, without genuinely considering how to exercise their discretion in the specific circumstances: Thamotharem at para 62; Stemijon Investments Ltd v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 299 [Stemijon Investments] at para 22, citing Maple Lodge Farms at p 6.

[111] However, merely showing that decision-makers were "influenced significantly by... policy and its objectives" falls short of establishing the requisite "blindness" to constitute fettering, as influence alone does not show that decision-makers "afforded no consideration to the possibility of" pursuing an alternative course: Publicover v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 659 at para 54; Thamotharem at para 59. Applicants bear the burden of showing that the decision-maker treated the policy as binding, ignoring their duty to exercise independent judgment based on the facts of each case: Shin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FC 1106.

[112] Once a court finds that discretion has been fettered, the decision must be set aside, as "a decision that is the product of a fettered discretion must per se be unreasonable:" Stemijon Investments at para 24; Barco v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 421 at para 20; Gordon v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 643 at para 28. No degree of deference can cure the flaw that flows from fettering.

[113] The prevailing view is that fettering does not engage a standard of review analysis in the usual sense. While some cases, such as Singh Bajwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 864 at para 46 have suggested that correctness may apply, the now prevailing view in the Federal Courts is that the core question is simply whether the decision was, in fact, the result of fettered discretion: Desgagnés Transarctik Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 14 at para 65; Austin v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1277 at para 16; Matharoo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 664 at para21; Yanasik v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 1319 at para 25.

[114] The Federal Courts have identified key factors to watch for within policy instruments for distinguishing between permissible guidance and impermissible fettering. In paragraph 64 of Thamotharem, the Federal Court of Appeal endorsed the approach from Ainsley Financial Corp. v Ontario Securities Commission, [1994] OJ No 2966 [Ainsley], which examines: 1) the language of the instrument; 2) the practical effect of non-compliance; and 3) the expectations of the agency and its staff regarding implementation. A policy that uses mandatory language, prescribes detailed procedures, threatens sanctions for non-compliance, and is treated by staff as binding law, is more likely to amount to fettering. The key question is whether a decision is made "solely by reference to the mandatory prescription of a guideline, despite a request to deviate from it in the light of the particular facts:" Thamotharem at para 62.

[115] Two Federal Court cases applying section 48 of the Act have further clarified the distinction between permissible policy guidance and impermissible fettering in the multi-step decision-making of infected animal disposal. In David Hunt FC, Justice Cullen found that fettering cannot arise where no independent judgment remained at the implementation level. That case involved a district veterinarian tasked with destroying cattle imported from the United Kingdom. The destruction decision followed a pre-established blanket policy directing that all cattle imported before 1990 be culled. Because the Minister had already made a categorical policy decision at the national level, the field officer's role was purely mechanical. Justice Cullen held that because no individual discretion survived at the field level, there was nothing left to fetter, a conclusion upheld on appeal: David Hunt FC at paras 33-37, aff'd David Hunt FCA at paras 3-7.

[116] In Jerram, the exercise of the same statutory power was upheld for the opposite reason: Justice Noël found that the regional inspector had residual discretion and genuinely exercised it. Specifically, the inspector "personally ascertained the circumstances of the subject bull," and then, during cross-examination, "referred to the decision... as his own" and "confirmed his conviction that the bull had to be destroyed": Jerram at para 35. Justice Noël emphasized that while the national policy strongly favoured destruction, it did not compel that outcome in every case. Therefore, what proved determinative was that the inspector's suspicion was genuinely formed and supported by evidence specific to the individual animal in question: Jerram at paras 42-52.

[117] These animal disease-control cases yield two foundational principles for analyzing fettering in multi-step administrative processes guided by a policy instrument. First, discretion must be understood as a unified whole across the entire process. Whether discretion of the overall process is fettered cannot be judged by looking at individual decision points in isolation. It must instead be assessed holistically, considering whether, when aggregated across the process, the appropriate overall level of discretion is preserved. Second, varying levels of discretion at different stages are permissible, provided that the process preserves the proportional discretionary authority mandated by statute. This framework explains why the outcomes in the David Hunt cases and Jerram align despite differing levels of in-field discretion. In the former, discretion was concentrated at earlier, ministerial stages, leaving implementation largely mechanical. For the latter, the policy left field-level officials with some meaningful discretionary power to assess the situation before them. Neither caused fettering because the decision-makers in each case properly exercised the discretion allocated to them within the respective policy frameworks.

[118] To summarize, when reviewing fettering claims in multi-phase administrative processes, courts should make two key considerations:

1) Evaluate the architecture of the entire administrative process to determine whether it as a whole preserves sufficient discretion for case-specific judgment or unlawfully diminishes discretion. This is a qualitative assessment of whether the overall process maintains discretionary power proportionate to what is granted by the statute or improperly removes or abandons discretion; and
2) Examine the specific decision-making step under review to determine how much discretion, if any, was left to the decision-maker at that step, and whether the individual properly exercised that discretion. This is the more traditional fettering inquiry, centered on whether the decision-maker treated non-binding soft law as legally binding.

## C. The law on legitimate expectation

[119] The doctrine of legitimate expectation is a core part of the procedural fairness principle. If an applicant has a legitimate expectation that a certain procedure will be followed, this procedure will be required by the duty of fairness: Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para 26; Agraira v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 [Agraira] at paras 94-95.

[120] To establish a legitimate expectation, applicants must demonstrate that the relevant public authority has made clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representations about the procedure it will follow, or have consistently adhered to certain procedural practices in the past: Canada (Attorney General) v Mavi, 2011 SCC 30 [Mavi] at para 68. Moreover, the representations must be within the authority's power to make, and applicants must have reasonably relied on the representations: Agraira at para 94.

[121] Applicants are entitled to rely on the administrative body's established procedures and publicly available policies, even if they are in general not legally binding. A failure by the decision-maker to follow its own procedures, or a unilateral departure from established practices without notice, may constitute a breach of procedural fairness: Tafreshi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 1089 at para 18; Kandiah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1096 [Kandiah] at paras 25-27.

[122] When an administrative body changes or deviates from its procedures in a way that affects applicants, procedural fairness may require that affected individuals be given notice of the changes and an opportunity to adjust or comply with the new procedures, especially if the changes or deviations could have significant or "fatal" consequences: Kandiah at paras 26-27; Popova v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 326 at para 11.

[123] However, the law is clear that the doctrine of legitimate expectation creates only procedural rights, not substantive ones: Agraira at para 97; Chelsea (Municipality) v Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 89 at para 36. Even if an individual had "a legitimate expectation that a particular outcome will be reached, that expectation is not enforceable": Canada (National Revenue) v JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc, 2013 FCA 250 [JP Morgan] at para 75; Jennings-Clyde, Inc. (Vivatas, Inc.) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FC 1141 [Jennings-Clyde] at para 40.

# VIII. Analysis

## A. Evidentiary issues: expert reports, affidavit, and Report of Inspector

### (1) There is No Need to Rule on the Admissibility and Weight of the Expert Reports

[124] I do not need to rule on the admissibility or weight of the challenged portions of the parties' expert reports, as the issues in this judicial review do not require weighing the scientific or technical insights they offer to properly conduct the reasonableness analysis. In fact, since the parties have marshalled their expert reports specifically to attack or defend the merits of the Stamping-Out Policy, examining and weighing these reports would lead to assessment of the Policy's merits. As described in the Legal Framework section, courts at all levels have consistently held that the merits of policy decisions are strictly off limits in a reasonableness review: Entertainment Software; South Shore; Kohl; Auer.

[125] The parties, especially the Applicant, have staked much of their respective cases on competing visions of the science and practice of avian-influenza control, and each vision is carried almost entirely through expert opinion. The Applicant's expert suite consists of three individuals drawn from outside of public service. Collectively, their reports are deployed by the Applicant attempting to show that the measures offered by the Stamping-Out Policy are neither scientifically supported nor the least-intrusive means available and, therefore, unreasonable in law.

[126] I summarize below in very broad strokes the key opinions offered in the expert reports submitted by both sides.

[127] Dr. Steven Pelech, a UBC professor and biochemist with years of training and experience in immunology and virology, supplies in his two reports the central thesis that the H5N1 detected at the Applicant's farm behaved phenotypically like a low-pathogenic strain. He cites as evidence the low mortality of adult birds, short-lived viral shedding, and the flock's likely attainment of immunity to the virus by mid-January. Dr. Pelech's conclusion goes to the heart of the Applicant's claim that CFIA's response failed to consider the disproportionality of implementing the Stamping-Out Policy on its premises as well as the lack of consideration of monitoring and further research, and therefore is unreasonable.

[128] Dr. Byram Bridle, an immunologist at the University of Guelph with research focused on virology, also furnishes microbiology and immunology opinions. He argues that detecting an H5 gene by RRT-PCR is not, without full pathotyping, proof of a highly pathogenic virus. Faced with a novel genotype, he opines, CFIA should first have performed a fresh risk assessment and considered vaccination or natural-immunity studies.

[129] Dr. Jeff Wilson, a current director of a veterinary science and infectious disease management consulting firm and former senior epidemiologist and manager at the Public Health Agency of Canada, overlays Dr. Pelech and Dr. Birdle's microbiology and immunology opinions with his epidemiological knowledge. Ostriches, Dr. Wilson says, live longer, range farther, and populate at far lower densities than conventional poultry, so close surveillance and targeted culling would have met international obligations with less collateral loss. Dr. Wilson further frames CFIA actions in adopting and implementing the Stamping-Out Policy as a policy failure when benchmarked against proper pandemic-response principles.

[130] The Respondent's scientific foundation rests on a single report by Dr. Shannon French, a CFIA veterinary epidemiologist who completed her doctorate research on the wildlife disease ecology of parasites and received various post-graduate trainings on epidemiology, virology, and poultry health management. Dr. French traces the full-genome sequencing that identified the virus on the Applicant's premises as a new HPAI H5N1 lineage, reviews international outbreak data illustrating silent but intense viral shedding in ratites, and explains why neither vaccination nor a "burn-out" strategy has gained WOAH endorsement for commercial poultry.

[131] Unsurprisingly, each side seeks to narrow the evidentiary footprint of the other, and asks this Court to rely on the opinion of their experts should opinions diverge. For the Respondent's expert report, the Applicant takes issue with Dr. French's impartiality, arguing that she joined CFIA as a doctoral student in 2020, and claiming her report strays into advocacy by endorsing the very policy under review. They also attempt to undermine the accuracy and credibility of her opinion on the characterization of the virus found on the Applicant's premises as an HPAI by pointing to her lack of specialized qualifications and experience focused on virology or immunology. The Applicant's counsel has not pinpointed any specific portions or paragraphs of Dr. French's affidavit that they ask to be struck or given no weight.

[132] For its part, the Respondent launches a two-pronged counterattack. It moves to strike 24 different portions of the Pelech, Wilson, and Bridle reports on the grounds that: 1) none of the authors have ever worked with ostrich production under outbreak conditions; 2) they rely on post-decision data and speculative modelling rather than contemporaneous evidence; and 3) their "herd-immunity" thesis sits well outside mainstream peer-reviewed literature. The Respondent also underlines that Drs. Pelech and Bridle have been criticized by courts in other legal proceedings for advocacy masquerading as expertise and have had their reports rejected. Concurrently, the Respondent defends Dr. French's credibility by pointing to her systematic review of relevant peer-reviewed literature, her concessions where data are uncertain, and the fact that her conclusions line up with WOAH manuals and with the culling protocol upon HPAI outbreaks in ostriches in South Africa, where the Applicant's line of flock reportedly originated.

[133] As previewed in the beginning of this section, I do not need to resolve the parties' battle over the admissibility and weight of their expert material. The dispute they invite the Court to referee is, in substance, a contest over whose science on the virus in question is "better" and therefore whose preferred animal and public health policy is "wiser." To decide a winner in this contest will cause this Court to commit two cardinal sins in reasonableness review. First, it will prompt this Court to reach beyond the legitimate scope of reasonableness review of a broad policy decision. Second, it will effectively make this Court an academy of science and an arbiter of truth in immunology and animal and public health.

[134] To reiterate, under Vavilov, this Court's task on this judicial review is to decide whether the Stamping-Out Policy, when read considering its enabling statute, falls within a range of outcomes that can be said to be rational, intelligible and justified. As the Federal Court of Appeal explained in Entertainment Software, decisions "very much unconstrained" by tight statutory language or adjudicative methodology, namely policy decisions with broad public interest implications, are correspondingly "harder to set aside" because merits-based disagreement is not a ground for intervention. The Stamping-Out Policy under review is precisely of that character. Like the policy decisions examined in South Shore and Kohl, it is a preventative, nationwide disease-control measure adopted to proactively manage and eradicate a serious threat to animal and public health, as well as international trade. As Auer teaches us, for such decisions, the reviewing court asks whether the policy can plausibly be located within the text, purpose and architecture of the Act, not whether it represents the optimal balance of virological, economic, or public health considerations.

[135] The rivalling expert reports add fuel to precisely such an inadmissible balancing exercise. The Applicant's evidence says the Stamping-Out Policy is economically wasteful, scientifically unnecessary, and ineffective, especially when it comes to the less studied situation of ostriches. The Respondent's evidence says it has been effective, epidemiologically indispensable, and trade-critical. Accepting either view would require me to adjudicate the substantive merits of the policy and, as support, to resolve contested matters of viral pathogenicity, host biology, export-market tolerance of policy changes and the like, a task the case law forbids: Coldwater First Nation at 119; Inverhuron at 40.

[136] Nor is it necessary to parse the expert evidence for the limited purpose of checking whether the CFIA had some evidentiary foundation to support its suspicion of HPAI infection and implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy during this wave of HPAI outbreak, including in the Applicant's situation specifically. The record already contains unchallenged factual materials, such as the existence of positive RRT-PCR results, whole-genome sequencing report, and information on contemporaneous HPAI outbreaks, on which the reasonableness of the suspicion and continuation of the Policy can be assessed. Whether different scientists might have drawn different risk conclusions, and which assessment this Court might prefer, is irrelevant to the reasonableness review at hand.

[137] In short, the parties' expert reports, however scientifically accurate, provide opinions on scientific truth, the weighing of which lies with the specialized administrative bodies, which are better positioned to assess the comparative prudence, efficacy, or proportionality of animal disease-control measures of general applicability. These are questions of policy merit and have no role in the reasonableness analysis of administrative decisions. For that reason, I decline to rule on the admissibility of the expert reports and afford them no weight in my reasons.

### (2) Dr. Cathy Furness' Affidavit is Admissible as Factual Narrative

[138] I find Dr. Cathy Furness' affidavit, tendered by the Respondent, admissible. To the extent that her affidavit refers to scientific concepts, these statements provide factual context for understanding CFIA's regulatory decisions rather than offering scientific or technical conclusions that would require expert qualification. Additionally, I treat those statements as factual narrative explaining what the CFIA understands and considers in its decision-making, not as definitive statements of scientific truth. I therefore find no basis to exclude Dr. Furness' affidavit or disregard portions of it as impermissible expert evidence.

[139] Dr. Furness is the Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer of the CFIA. Her affidavit offers background on the CFIA's understanding of the current HPAI outbreak that began in November 2021, the HPAI H5N1 virus detected at the Applicant's premises, and Canada's international obligations to implement the Stamping-Out Policy upon detection of HPAI. It also explains how the Stamping-Out Policy facilitates a faster return to disease-free status according to relevant international treaty, protects Canada's export markets through negotiated trade agreements, and supports coordinated global efforts to reduce public health risks from this zoonotic disease. The affidavit further details the Agency's legal authority under the Act, the specific application of these policies to the UOF case including the denial of their exemption request, and the coordinated federal-provincial response framework between CFIA and British Columbia authorities.

[140] The Applicant's counsel first raised their objection to the admissibility of this affidavit at the hearing. They insist that Dr. Furness' affidavit is inadmissible because it contains statements that offer opinion on technical and scientific matters, but is never tendered as an expert report properly qualified under Rule 52.2 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106. However, they did not identify any specific paragraphs or portions of the affidavit they sought to have struck or disregarded.

[141] The Respondent's counsel objected to the Applicant's challenge, noting that the case management judge had directed the parties identify any admissibility objections in advance of the hearing. Respondent's counsel argued that raising the challenge for the first time at the hearing was contrary to that direction. Respondent's counsel also asked for the specific parts of Dr. Furness' affidavit which the Applicant's counsel had challenged, so that they could address it in their submission. I agreed with the Respondent at the hearing on the request for clarification and pressed the Applicant to identify the challenged portions. In response, Applicant's counsel stated: "it is quite obvious when you read [Dr. Furness'] report where she is offering virology or immunology opinions."

[142] I am of the view that the Applicant's evidentiary challenge here must fail, if not for the fact that it did not observe case management procedures, than for the fact that, contrary to what the Applicant's counsel claims, Dr. Furness' affidavit does not obviously contain the type of statement that veers into expert evidence on virology and immunology.

[143] Having carefully reviewed Dr. Furness' affidavit in detail, I find this characterization inaccurate. The statements contained therein predominantly consist of facts that one would expect a Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer to possess through her official position, responsibilities, and direct involvement in Canada's HPAI response. Jurisprudence is clear that such information does not constitute "expert information, since it was not the kind of information that could only be acquired and understood with special training or expertise," but rather information gained through knowledge, observation, and experience in the ordinary course of one's position: R. v Millard, 2023 ONCA 426 at para 108; R. v Hamilton, 2011 ONCA 399 at para 277.

[144] For example, when Dr. Furness describes avian influenza variants being categorized into HPAI and LPAI strains or identifies which subtypes are listed in the Reportable Diseases Regulations, SOR/91-2, she is stating factual information learned from her responsibilities, not offering specialized scientific opinions that require specialized training. Similarly, when describing the current outbreak timeline, detection of specific virus subtypes, or international standards for response, Dr. Furness is stating facts directly accessible in her role. Her statements about the absence of effective treatments for HPAI in birds represent factual declarations about available options within CFIA's policy framework, not scientific opinions on treatment efficacy. These are matters that would reasonably be known to anyone in her position without requiring special expertise beyond what is necessary for her role. It is particularly telling that, when making these statements, she cites and attaches supporting documentation as exhibits, which include fact sheets and publications from authorities such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization. In other words, Dr. Furness is recounting and relaying information from these established sources, rather than communicating her opinions on scientific matters.

[145] The remaining portions of Dr. Furness' affidavit similarly consist of factual statements, such as descriptions of relevant WOAH standards, CFIA internal processes, and federal-provincial coordination frameworks, all of which fall within the realm of factual narrative. Her account of the Stamping-Out Policy's requirements and the consequences for disease-free status restates international standards that guide the CFIA's work. Her descriptions of the CFIA's emergency response framework, hazard-specific plans, and operational procedures reflect institutional knowledge directly linked to her official role. When detailing the coordinated response with British Columbia authorities, including the liaison officer structure, weekly meetings, and information-sharing protocols, Dr. Furness provides facts about administrative arrangements known to her through ordinary professional experience, not through specialized scientific training and expertise. These are precisely the kinds of statements expected from a senior public official addressing matters within her regulatory and operational mandate, not scientific opinions based on specialized training and expertise.

### (3) The Respondent's Report of the CFIA Inspector is Admissible Under the Business Record Exception

[146] The last piece of evidentiary dispute I must address before turning to the substance of the reasonableness analysis is whether the one-page "Inspection Report" dated January 31, 2025, and tendered as Exhibit O to the affidavit of Dr. Cathy Furness, may be received as evidence of what occurred during CFIA Inspector Dykstra's onsite visit of and the testing done at the Applicant's premises on December 30, 2024. I find that it is, based on the business record exception provided by section 30 of the Canada Evidence Act, RSC 1985, c C-5 [the CEA].

[147] The Inspection Report is a formal summary of the site visit of the Applicant's premises conducted by Inspector Dykstra, with particular focus on the availability of carcasses for sampling and the applicable biosecurity measure. The Report shows that Inspector Dykstra explained that "he would like to swab up to ten mortalities," but the Applicant's principal who accompanied him "stated there were only two mortalities in good enough condition to be sampled" since "the remaining mortalities had either been scavenged on by wild animals or were in later stages of decomposition." The Applicant contests this account, alleging that Inspector Dykstra refused additional carcasses despite being offered more. Based on this alternative version of events, the Applicant argues that the CFIA failed to comply with section 4 of the 2022 ERP, which requires sampling of all available dead birds up to ten at maximum, and therefore lacked a sufficient factual foundation for reasonably issuing the Notice to Dispose.

[148] The Applicant submits that the Report of Inspector should be struck as inadmissible hearsay that falls outside of the business record exception, applying evaluative frameworks in Ares v Venner, [1970] SCR 608 [Ares] and Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v Teva Canada Limited, 2017 FC 88 [Eli Lilly]. The Applicant advances three main arguments in support of this position. First, the Report lacks contemporaneity, as it was signed a month after the site visit without explanation for the delay. Second, the way the Report is tendered does not satisfy the personal knowledge element, since Inspector Dykstra did not provide direct evidence about the circumstances surrounding its creation. Third, the Report lacks independence, asserting that it was prepared "in contemplation of litigation," given that the CFIA had been notified of the Applicant's intention to seek judicial review of the Notice to Dispose shortly before the Report was finalized.

[149] The Applicant's objections rest on a misunderstanding of the law and a failure to read the Report of Inspector in conjunction with other similar reports furnished by the Respondent. The legal error concerns the requirement for personal knowledge. The Applicant's counsel specifically emphasized during the hearing that "we have no evidence from... Dykstra... the inspector, as to how and why he created the record a month later, the circumstances surrounding his creation of it." This submission misstates what is required to satisfy the personal knowledge requirement. The correct inquiry is whether the author of the document, in this case Inspector Dykstra, had personal knowledge of the matters being recorded, not whether the document must be tendered and supported by a direct attestation from that author personally.

[150] As the Supreme Court held in Ares, the reliability of business records arises from the circumstances of their creation, not the presence of the author:

Hospital records, including nurses' notes, made contemporaneously by someone having a personal knowledge of the matters then being recorded and under a duty to make the entry or record should be received in evidence as prima facie proof of the facts stated therein.

[151] The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the notion that the author's testimony is required to validate such records, pointing to the impracticality of demanding testimony from specific individuals in large organizations where "clerks and servants are changed from time to time, whose evidence may be difficult and often impossible to obtain": Ares at p 619, citing Ashdown Hardware Co. v Singer et al (1951), 3 WWR (NS) 145 (AD CA). This understanding of the personal knowledge element has not been modified by this Court in Eli Lilly, nor by the Federal Court of Appeal on appeal: Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v Teva Canada Limited, 2018 FCA 53. Accordingly, the relevant inquiry here is whether the author of the record, Inspector Dykstra, had firsthand knowledge of the events recorded. Whether he provided a direct attestation about the context in which the report was created is irrelevant. That function was properly fulfilled by Dr. Furness, who has explained in her affidavit about how the preparation of such reports are done in the ordinary course of business at the CFIA.

[152] The business record exception exists because institutional safeguards enhance reliability. The Applicant's insistence on requiring direct evidence from Inspector Dykstra misapprehends this underlying rationale of the exception. It is neither practical nor necessary to call every author of a record when institutional practices ensure its trustworthiness. In a national agency like the CFIA, where frontline officers like Inspector Dykstra routinely document field
