The Evolving Landscape of H5N1 Avian Influenza in Canada and the United States: A May 2025 AssessmentI. Executive SummaryAs of May 2025, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus presents a complex and evolving challenge across North America. In both Canada and the United States, the virus is extensively distributed within wild bird populations, which serve as persistent reservoirs, leading to recurrent outbreaks in domestic poultry. The scale of these poultry outbreaks is notably larger in the United States, with significant economic repercussions, particularly for the egg industry. A critical divergence in the epidemiological landscape is the emergence and widespread transmission of H5N1 within U.S. dairy cattle herds since March 2024, a situation that, despite extensive surveillance, has not been mirrored in Canadian dairy cattle. This development in the U.S. has introduced new transmission dynamics and pathways for human exposure.Sporadic human cases of H5N1, primarily linked to direct contact with infected animals (poultry and, in the U.S., dairy cattle), have been reported in both nations. While these cases are infrequent and no sustained human-to-human transmission has been identified, the detection of viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation in some human isolates underscores the zoonotic potential and the imperative for ongoing vigilance. Public health agencies in both countries currently assess the risk to the general public as low, though it is elevated for individuals with occupational or direct exposure to infected animals.Governmental responses in Canada and the United States involve substantial financial investment and multi-agency efforts focused on surveillance, outbreak control through measures like culling and quarantine, biosecurity enhancement, public health guidance, and research into viral evolution and countermeasures, including vaccines. The economic impacts are considerable, ranging from direct losses in the poultry and dairy sectors to broader effects on food prices and international trade. The continuous evolution of the H5N1 virus, its expanding host range, and its capacity for interspecies transmission necessitate robust, adaptive, and collaborative One Health approaches to monitor and mitigate the multifaceted risks it poses to animal health, agricultural stability, and public health.II. Current Status of H5N1 Avian Influenza in Canada (as of May 2025)A. Outbreaks in Poultry and Other Domestic BirdsCanada continues to experience H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks across its diverse poultry sector, impacting various types of operations and geographic regions. As of May 16, 2025, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) reported 18 active infected poultry premises (IPs) across the country. Cumulatively, 520 premises had been infected and subsequently released from quarantine, with the total number of birds affected by mortality or depopulation reaching 14,566,000.1 Data from May 1, 2025, indicated 14 current outbreaks in Canadian poultry.2The provincial distribution of these active infections as of mid-May 2025 highlights the widespread nature of the issue: Alberta and British Columbia each had two current IPs; Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia also reported two IPs each. Ontario had the highest number with four current IPs, while Prince Edward Island had one, and Saskatchewan reported three. Quebec and New Brunswick had no current IPs listed at that time.1Table 1: H5N1 Detections in Canadian Domestic Bird Flocks by Province (as of May 16, 2025)ProvinceNumber of current infected premises (IPs)Number of previously infected premises (released IPs)Estimated number of birds impactedAlberta2852,019,000British Columbia22378,735,000Manitoba224408,000New Brunswick02Under 100Newfoundland and Labrador22400Nova Scotia2812,000Ontario4571,175,000Prince Edward Island10200Quebec0591,465,500Saskatchewan346751,000Total1852014,566,000Source: 1Recent incidents underscore the ongoing activity. In Saskatchewan, testing confirmed the H5 strain of avian flu in hundreds of dead Ross's geese found near Lipton in spring 2025. This event led to the quarantine of three farms: one in the Rural Municipality (RM) of Lipton (a non-commercial, non-poultry premise), one in the RM of Colonsay (a non-commercial poultry operation), and a third in the RM of Indian Head.3 The Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment characterized the scale of wild goose mortality as unusual for the spring season, exceeding typical levels though not reaching the peaks observed in 2022 when the virus was newer to Canadian bird populations.3 The strain identified in the Lipton-area geese was reported to be the same as that detected at a British Columbia ostrich farm.3 This ostrich farm, Universal Ostrich Farms in Edgewood, B.C., became the subject of a CFIA-ordered cull after 69 birds died in December and January. The cull proceeded despite requests from the farm owners and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to spare the remaining 400 birds for scientific study, as the owners believed they had acquired herd immunity.4In Ontario, the winter 2024â€“2025 season saw 12 poultry premises (11 commercial flocks and 1 small flock) in the southern part of the province confirmed with HPAI H5N1. All affected flocks were depopulated, and the premises were placed under CFIA quarantine as per federal eradication policy.6 Beyond H5N1, the CFIA also detected low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtype H5 in Quebec on November 25, 2024, and confirmed HPAI H5N5 in poultry in Newfoundland and Labrador on February 12, 2025, indicating surveillance and detection of multiple avian influenza subtypes.7The continued emergence of H5N1 in diverse Canadian poultry operations, spanning commercial, non-commercial, and even non-poultry premises across multiple provinces 1, occurs despite established biosecurity protocols and active responses by the CFIA.1 This pattern underscores the persistent threat posed by wild bird reservoirs, which serve as a continuous source of viral introduction. Furthermore, these ongoing outbreaks point to the inherent difficulties in maintaining infallible biosecurity across all agricultural settings and the potential for environmental contamination to facilitate viral spread. The quarantine of a non-commercial, non-poultry premise in Saskatchewan 3, for instance, illustrates the virus's capacity to surface in less conventional settings, thereby broadening the scope of surveillance and control challenges.The situation at the B.C. ostrich farm, which involved public protests and a high-profile request for sparing birds for research 4, brings to light the complex socio-political and ethical dimensions that can overlay outbreak management. Such events can add significant pressure to authorities tasked with disease control. Reports of CFIA staff facing "intimidation and threats" in relation to the planned cull 5 further emphasize the human stress and operational difficulties encountered during these responses, extending beyond purely epizootiological considerations.B. Surveillance and Detections in Wild Bird PopulationsWild birds are the primary natural reservoir for H5N1 viruses, and their migratory movements are a principal driver of the virus's geographic dissemination, posing an ongoing threat to domestic poultry and other susceptible species. Surveillance data from Canada indicate continued viral circulation at significant levels in these populations.In Saskatchewan, the discovery of hundreds of dead Ross's geese near Lipton in spring 2025, which subsequently tested positive for the H5 strain of avian flu, was a notable event.3 Wildlife health specialists with the provincial Ministry of Environment described an "unusual to see this scale of mortality" and an general increase in mortality within wild bird populations, although these levels had not reached the highs of 2022.3 Professor Trent Bollinger of the Western College of Veterinary Medicine and the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) corroborated this, noting an increase in dead birds submitted for avian flu testing and autopsies. He anticipated a decline in these numbers as migratory seasons conclude and pointed out that Alberta was not experiencing a similar surge, potentially due to differing goose flyways.3 This observation directly illustrates how avian migration routes influence the local intensity of H5N1 circulation, with clear implications for targeted surveillance and the timing of biosecurity advisories for poultry producers, which should be heightened during peak migration periods along known flyways. The CFIA has also acknowledged that climate change may affect wild bird migration patterns, potentially increasing the scale and frequency of H5N1 outbreaks.9Cumulatively, since November 3, 2021, the CWHC has reported 2,537 positive HPAI detections in wild birds across Canada, with 413 of these occurring in Ontario.6 For the period between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 52 of 2024, Canada reported 120 HPAI A(H5N1) outbreaks in poultry and wild birds to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) across 11 provinces and territories.10 More recently, between EW 1 and EW 8 of 2025, Canada reported seven HPAI A(H5N1) outbreaks in poultry to WOAH, located in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.11The reports of "hundreds of dead birds reported at sites" 3 in Saskatchewan geese suggest that the circulating H5N1 strains possess high virulence in these wild populations, not solely in domestic poultry. Such significant mortality events in wild birds lead to a higher environmental viral load, thereby increasing the risk of spillover into domestic animal populations and potentially to humans.C. Detections in Mammalian Species (Non-Human)A critical point of distinction between the H5N1 situation in Canada and the United States is the status of dairy cattle. As of early 2025, the HPAI virus genotype B3.13, which has been found in U.S. dairy cattle, had not been detected in Canadian birds, cattle, or any other animals.7 This remains the case as of May 26, 2025, with no H5N1 cases identified in Canadian dairy cattle.12 This absence is supported by extensive surveillance: by May 8, 2025, CFIA laboratories had tested 3,498 raw milk samples collected from trucks arriving at processing plants in all provinces, with all samples testing negative.12 Similarly, 1,211 retail milk samples tested by September 5, 2024, were also all negative.13 This robust and proactive surveillance of the Canadian dairy sector, particularly the widespread milk testing initiative, demonstrates a significant effort to monitor for any introduction of the virus, especially in light of the U.S. situation. The consistent negative results provide strong evidence that widespread infection, akin to that in U.S. dairy herds, has not occurred in Canada to date.Despite the absence in cattle, Canada has reported H5N1 in other mammalian species. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) indicated that between 2022 and EW 52 of 2024, Canada was among eight countries in the Americas reporting H5N1 outbreaks in mammals. The PAHO report attributed 982 such "outbreaks" in mammals to Canada during 2024 alone.10 This figure appears exceptionally high and likely requires careful interpretation; it may represent the aggregation of individual wild mammal detections (e.g., skunks, foxes) reported to WOAH, rather than distinct outbreaks in managed or domestic mammal populations. This contrasts with the clear definition of herd outbreaks in the U.S. dairy context. Specific reports confirm HPAI A(H5N1) infections in foxes in Canada.14 The CFIA is actively monitoring the global situation regarding H5N1 in various wild and domestic mammalian species.6 The Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative dashboard serves as a resource for details on these wild mammal detections.16 Clarifying the nature of these mammal "outbreaks" is important to accurately represent Canada's H5N1 status in mammals relative to the U.S. dairy crisis.D. Human Cases and Public Health Risk AssessmentCanada has recorded its first domestically acquired human case of avian influenza A(H5N1). On November 13, 2024, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) confirmed the infection in a teenage girl in British Columbia who was subsequently hospitalized.2 Genomic sequencing of the virus from this case linked it to the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.1, which was circulating in poultry in the region. Notably, the virus also possessed the E627K mutation in the PB2 gene, a marker associated with increased viral replication in mammals.11 The precise source of her infection remains unknown, and no additional related cases have been reported.11 This case is significant not only as the first domestic acquisition in Canada but also because the detected viral mutation signals a potential shift in local viral characteristics and exposure risks, warranting heightened vigilance.Despite this case, PHAC maintains that the overall risk of A(H5N1) infection to people in Canada remains low.17 However, the agency acknowledges an increased risk for individuals who have higher levels of exposure to infected animals or highly contaminated environments.17 Crucially, there is currently no evidence to suggest that the H5N1 virus is capable of spreading efficiently and sustainably among humans.17In terms of preparedness, PHAC has taken proactive steps, including the purchase of 500,000 doses of human vaccine against avian influenza. These vaccines are held for potential use should the public health threat escalate, for example, if sustained human-to-human transmission were to occur.17 This procurement, despite the current low-risk assessment for the general populace, indicates that Canadian health authorities are actively preparing for scenarios where the risk profile could change.E. National Response: CFIA and PHAC Strategies and Control MeasuresCanada's response to H5N1 avian influenza is a coordinated federal effort, primarily led by the CFIA for animal health aspects and PHAC for human health. A significant financial commitment underpins these efforts, with $27.9 million allocated for the 2024-2025 fiscal year to support early detection, active prevention, and rapid response measures for HPAI A(H5N1).9The overarching goals of this strategy include maintaining the current response to poultry outbreaks, ensuring timely emergency preparedness and response to protect both human and animal health, minimizing viral transmission in domestic poultry, reducing the threat to cattle and other animals, safeguarding the food supply, maintaining public health, preserving export markets for Canadian poultry and dairy products, minimizing financial burdens on affected sectors, and enhancing research and surveillance systems.9Key activities undertaken by the CFIA include responding to detections of both HPAI and LPAI subtype H5 in domestic birds.1 This involves the humane depopulation of infected flocks to prevent further spread 9, rigorous promotion of on-farm biosecurity measures 1, and comprehensive surveillance programs. A notable component of this surveillance is the proactive testing of milk from dairy cattle, which, as previously mentioned, has consistently yielded negative results.12 The CFIA also supports research initiatives and efforts towards animal vaccine development.9 Furthermore, to protect national animal health, the agency restricts the import of bird by-products from international regions experiencing active HPAI outbreaks.1PHAC is responsible for public health risk assessments, providing guidance to the public and healthcare professionals, monitoring for human cases of A(H5N1), and coordinating the public health response if cases occur.17 The agency's preparedness measures include the strategic stockpiling of human H5N1 vaccines.17This comprehensive approach reflects an understanding of the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, often referred to as a "One Health" strategy. The allocation of dedicated funding and the specific objectives aimed at protecting the dairy sector and supporting animal vaccine development suggest that Canada's strategy is, in part, informed by and learning from the H5N1 developments in the United States, particularly the dairy cattle outbreak.An important dimension of Canada's long-term strategic planning is the acknowledged potential influence of climate change on H5N1 epidemiology. CFIA documents note that climate change may alter wild bird migration patterns and that increasing temperatures and changing ecosystems could potentially increase the scale and frequency of H5N1 outbreaks, as well as the likelihood of viral mutation.9 While recognizing that scientific research on this linkage is still evolving, the inclusion of this factor in funding proposals and strategic considerations indicates a forward-looking approach that incorporates broader environmental drivers into national disease management planning.III. Current Status of H5N1 Avian Influenza in the United States (as of May 2025)The United States is confronting a significant and widespread HPAI H5N1 epizootic, characterized by extensive outbreaks in poultry, the novel emergence and spread in dairy cattle, and detections across a diverse range of wild bird and other mammalian species.A. Nationwide Outbreaks in Commercial and Backyard PoultryThe impact of HPAI H5N1 on the U.S. poultry industry has been substantial and geographically widespread. As of May 20, 2025, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that 171,554,878 poultry had been affected across 51 jurisdictions since the beginning of the current outbreak wave on February 8, 2022.23 More recent figures focusing on the period since April 2024, reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS), detailed H5 virus detections in 336 commercial flocks and 207 backyard flocks, impacting over 90.9 million birds.25 An earlier count, as of November 20, 2024, cited 108,412,219 birds affected in commercial and backyard flocks across nearly all U.S. states since early 2022.26 Another report from March 2025 stated that 166.16 million birds (764 commercial flocks, 841 backyard flocks) had been affected since February 2022.27 These figures, while varying slightly due to different reporting periods and cumulative totals, collectively paint a picture of an immense challenge to the poultry sector.Recent detections in late May 2025 continued to affirm the virus's activity, with confirmations in live bird markets in Queens County, New York, and a backyard flock in Jefferson County, New York. Concurrently, outbreaks were identified at a poultry farm in Curry County, New Mexico, and a backyard flock in Roosevelt County, New Mexico.28 The persistence of H5N1 in live bird markets is a particular concern, as these environments, where birds from diverse origins are congregated, can act as significant amplification points and hubs for viral dissemination, necessitating targeted surveillance and stringent biosecurity within these specific market systems.In response to this crisis, the USDA is leveraging substantial resources, including a $1 billion investment aimed at curbing HPAI, protecting the U.S. poultry industry, and mitigating the impact on consumer egg prices. This funding supports enhanced biosecurity measures on farms and provides financial relief to affected producers.27 It is also important to note that surveillance efforts are not limited to H5N1; for instance, APHIS confirmed an outbreak of H7N9 HPAI in a U.S. flock on March 17, 2025, indicating broader vigilance for various HPAI strains.29The sheer scale of poultry affectedâ€”over 170 million birds 23â€”and the geographical extent of outbreaks across almost all states 26 over several years underscore the extreme difficulty in controlling and eradicating the virus from this sector once it has been widely introduced. Despite extensive federal financial investment and control efforts, including depopulation and biosecurity promotion, new outbreaks continue to emerge. This highlights the immense challenge posed by factors such as the vast and mobile wild bird reservoir, the virus's environmental resilience, and the complexities of ensuring perfect biosecurity across a large and diverse national industry. The fact that 67 commercial poultry farms have experienced reinfection at least twice, with 19 of those farms being infected three or more times during the current outbreak 27, starkly illustrates this persistent challenge.B. Emergence and Spread in Dairy Cattle and Other LivestockA pivotal development in the North American H5N1 situation was the first-ever confirmation of the virus in U.S. dairy cattle on March 25, 2024.32 Since this initial detection, the virus has spread significantly within this new host population. As of May 22, 2025, 1,070 dairy herds across 17 states were reported by the CDC as affected.23 Other USDA APHIS updates around the same period provided similar figures, with slight variations depending on the exact reporting date (e.g., 1,009 herds in 17 states 28; 1,020 herds in 17 states 34). Specific state counts include California with 766 affected herds and Idaho with 100.33In response to this novel emergence, the USDA implemented critical regulatory and surveillance measures. An April 2024 Federal Order mandated pre-movement testing for H5N1 in lactating dairy cattle moving interstate.32 This was followed by a December 2024 Federal Order establishing a National Milk Testing Strategy, which involves comprehensive surveillance of the nation's milk supply.32 A voluntary Dairy Herd Status Program was also introduced, offering producers the option of weekly bulk tank milk testing to facilitate interstate movement; approximately 100 herds across 18 states were enrolled in this program.35Clinical presentation in affected dairy cattle typically includes decreased appetite, reduced milk production, and changes in milk consistency (thickened, discolored, colostrum-like). Lethargy and fever may also occur. While morbidity can be high within affected herds, the virus has generally not been highly pathogenic in cattle, with most animals recovering with supportive care and a low mortality or culling rate, reported at 2% or less on average.32Genomic analysis has revealed some evolution of the virus within the dairy cattle population. The initial H5N1 clade identified in cattle was 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. Subsequently, a second genotype, D1.1â€”which was the predominant genotype circulating in North American wild bird flyways during the fall and winter of 2024-2025 and has been identified in wild birds, mammals, and poultry spilloversâ€”was confirmed in dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona.33 The presence of multiple H5N1 genotypes in dairy cattle suggests either multiple independent spillover events from different avian sources or potential evolution and reassortment of the virus within the cattle population itself. This genetic diversity adds complexity to control strategies and vaccine development considerations.Regarding transmission dynamics, USDA APHIS has indicated that continued regional spread between dairy farms is likely associated with normal operational movements of cattle, people, vehicles, and equipment, rather than direct spillover from migratory waterfowl onto dairy premises.32 This suggests that once H5N1 was introduced into the dairy system, lateral spread mechanisms (cow-to-cow or indirect transmission via fomites) became efficient drivers of the epidemic within this novel host. This is a critical distinction from many poultry outbreaks that are often directly linked to wild bird activity.Beyond dairy cattle, H5N1 has also been detected in other U.S. livestock, albeit more sporadically. In late 2024 (October-November), the virus was found in two pigs on a non-commercial backyard farm in Oregon where poultry on the same premises were also infected with H5N1.10 Additionally, HPAI A(H5N1) has been reported in goats.14 The USDA is providing financial assistance to dairy producers to help offset losses from reduced milk production, cover costs for enhanced biosecurity, and support testing efforts.29Recent modeling studies, such as one published in Nature Communications in May 2025 (based on research from January 2025), suggest that current mitigation measures for dairy cattle, primarily focused on testing for interstate movement, may be insufficient to control the epidemic. The model indicates a likelihood of significant underreporting of infections and predicts continued spread throughout 2025, highlighting states like Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, and Indiana as being at high risk for future outbreaks.39 This suggests that the existing federal orders, while important, might not be adequate to halt viral transmission within the highly interconnected U.S. dairy system without further enhancements to farm-level biosecurity and more comprehensive surveillance strategies.C. Surveillance and Detections in Wild Bird PopulationsWild birds remain the principal reservoir for H5N1 viruses in the United States, continuously seeding the environment and posing an ongoing risk to domestic animal populations. As of May 22, 2025, the CDC reported 13,037 detections of H5N1 in wild birds across 51 jurisdictions since January 20, 2022.23 The USDA APHIS maintains a Wild Bird Surveillance Dashboard, which provides detailed information on these detections, including species, location, and date, often clustered by county.29 Recent HPAI detections in May 2025, for example, included species such as house sparrows and common grackles in South Dakota, black vultures in Florida, Canada geese and blue jays in Iowa, and a bald eagle in North Carolina.42The USDA APHIS wild bird surveillance program serves as an essential early warning system for the introduction and distribution of avian influenza viruses of concern.43 The currently circulating H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is understood to have spread to North America in 2021 via waterfowl flyways from Europe, Africa, and Asia.10The diversity of wild bird species affected by H5N1 in the U.S. is noteworthy. While waterfowl (ducks, geese, swans) and raptors (eagles, hawks) are commonly associated with HPAI, detections in passerine species such as house sparrows and blue jays 42 suggest a broadening ecological niche for the virus. These smaller bird species often live in closer proximity to human dwellings, backyard poultry, and livestock facilities than some migratory waterfowl, potentially creating different or more frequent interfaces for viral spillover. This expansion of the wild bird host range could complicate risk assessments and control efforts.Long-term surveillance data from wild bird populations are critical for understanding viral evolution, persistence, and spread dynamics. However, it is noted by APHIS that the prioritization of HPAI testing may lead to delays in reporting for other avian influenza viruses (AIVs).41 While this prioritization is understandable in the context of an HPAI emergency, it could potentially reduce real-time visibility into the circulation and evolution of other AIVs, including low pathogenic H5 or H7 strains that have the potential to mutate into highly pathogenic forms. A fully comprehensive risk picture benefits from timely data on all relevant AIVs circulating in wild bird reservoirs.D. Detections in Other Mammalian Species (including domestic pets)The H5N1 virus has demonstrated a concerning ability to infect a wide array of mammalian species in the United States, beyond livestock. Since 2022, USDA APHIS has reported HPAI A(H5N1) in over 200 individual mammals across numerous species.14 This list includes domestic cats; wild felids such as mountain lions, tigers, leopards, and bobcats; various carnivores like skunks, red and Arctic foxes, raccoons, black and brown bears, polar bears, American marten, American mink, fisher, and North American river otter; marine mammals including grey seals, harbor seals, and bottlenose dolphins; and other species such as Virginia opossums, squirrels, desert cottontails, and various mouse species.14Domestic cats have been particularly affected, with the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirming over 130 feline cases of HPAI H5N1 since December 2022.46 Cats are described as "exquisitely sensitive" to the virus 46, and infections have often been severe, leading to neurological signs and death.33 A significant transmission route for these feline infections has been identified as the consumption of contaminated raw animal products. Specifically, H5N1 has been found in cats that died after consuming raw colostrum or unpasteurized milk from infected dairy cows.33 Contaminated raw meat pet food has also been implicated, leading to product recalls, such as for Savage Cat Food.46 This establishes a clear foodborne pathway for H5N1 transmission to susceptible mammals, which has direct implications for pet owners, especially in areas where H5N1 is circulating in dairy cattle or poultry.Recent mammalian detections reported in April 2025 further illustrate the ongoing spillover, with cases in domestic cats in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Illinois; skunks in New Mexico and Texas; house mice in Iowa; an Arctic fox in Alaska; a red fox in New York; a raccoon in Kentucky; and a bobcat in Connecticut.47While cats are generally considered to be dead-end hosts for avian influenza viruses, meaning they do not typically contribute significantly to onward transmission of the virus 46, the frequency and severity of infections are cause for concern regarding animal welfare and potential human exposure from close contact with infected pets.The increasing number and variety of wild mammal species found infected with H5N1 suggest that the virus is frequently spilling over from infected birds, likely through predation or scavenging of infected carcasses. While many of these infected wild mammals may also be dead-end hosts, sustained circulation within certain wildlife populations could potentially lead to viral adaptation within those species. Such adaptation could alter transmission dynamics, create new environmental reservoirs, or even facilitate pathways for the virus to re-transmit to other animal species, including domestic animals or humans. This broad host range in mammals underscores the virus's adaptability and the complexity of its ecological footprint.E. Human Cases and Public Health Risk AssessmentWhile H5N1 avian influenza primarily affects birds and other animals, sporadic human infections continue to be a significant public health concern in the United States, particularly given the virus's evolving nature and expanding host range. From 2022 to mid-April 2025, a total of 71 human cases of influenza A(H5) were identified in the U.S..50 Focusing on the period since the emergence of H5N1 in dairy cattle, 70 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) were reported between April 2024 and May 2025.11 Of these 70 recent cases, 41 were associated with exposure to infected dairy cows, 26 were linked to exposure to infected poultry, and for three cases, the source of exposure could not be determined.25 One fatality was reported in 2025: a senior in Louisiana with underlying medical conditions who was hospitalized with HPAI H5N1 after exposure to backyard poultry flocks and wild birds.6A critical development was the confirmation by the CDC of a human HPAI A(H5N1) infection in a dairy worker in Texas, which is considered the first instance of likely mammal-to-human transmission of this virus.14 This shift in exposure source, with dairy cattle now accounting for the majority of recent human cases, has altered the risk landscape for specific occupational groups. Dairy workers now face a heightened risk, necessitating targeted occupational health guidance and protective measures.Despite these human infections, the CDC has consistently assessed the current public health risk to the general U.S. population as low.23 However, for populations with direct or prolonged exposure to infected animals or contaminated environmentsâ€”such as poultry workers, dairy workers, and animal health respondersâ€”the risk is assessed as moderate to high.25 Crucially, to date, no confirmed or sustained human-to-human transmission of the A(H5) virus has been identified in the United States.25CDC's national influenza surveillance systems, including FluSurv-NET, have shown no indicators of unusual influenza activity in the general human population, including any signals of widespread A(H5) circulation.23 Extensive monitoring of individuals exposed to infected animals is ongoing. As of May 23, 2025, at least 26,000 people had been monitored post-exposure since February 2022, with 1,180 of them being tested for novel influenza A. Since the dairy outbreak began in March 2024, at least 16,700 people have been monitored (including 9,300 with dairy cow exposures), and at least 880 have been tested (including 218 with dairy cow exposures).24 The relatively small number of confirmed human cases resulting from this large pool of monitored and tested individuals suggests that current H5N1 strains are not highly transmissible to humans, that many infections may be asymptomatic or very mild and thus go undetected, or that recommended personal protective equipment and precautions are providing some level of protection in high-exposure settings. The CDC has recently expanded its testing recommendations to include offering tests to asymptomatic individuals who have had a high likelihood of unprotected exposure to the H5N1 virus, aiming to better capture the full spectrum of infection.51Genetic analyses of viruses isolated from some human cases have revealed mutations of concern. For instance, viruses from human cases in Wyoming and Nevada exhibited mutations previously associated with more efficient H5N1 virus replication in mammalian cells and in humans.51 However, the virus sequenced from a more recent human case in Ohio (clade 2.3.4.4b, D1.3 genotype) did not show any genetic markers that would negatively impact the effectiveness of existing influenza antiviral medications or candidate vaccine viruses, nor did it exhibit changes suggesting better adaptation to spread among or infect mammals.25 This underscores the importance of continuous genomic surveillance, as each human infection provides an opportunity for the virus to acquire mutations that could enhance its adaptation to mammalian hosts, including humans.Currently available FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir, are effective against the H5N1 strains circulating in the U.S. These medications are recommended for the treatment of confirmed or suspected H5N1 virus infection and can also be used for post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals who have had unprotected exposure to infected animals.51Table 2: Overview of H5N1 Detections in U.S. Animal Populations (Cumulative/Recent as of May 2025)

Sources: 14F. National Response: USDA, CDC, and FDA Strategies and Control MeasuresThe U.S. response to the H5N1 avian influenza situation is a large-scale, multi-agency effort involving the USDA, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reflecting the multifaceted nature of the threat to animal health, public health, and the food supply. This response has been characterized by the rapid deployment of regulatory measures, extensive financial support for affected industries, and an adaptive approach to surveillance and research.USDA APHIS spearheads the animal health response. This includes comprehensive surveillance programs for H5N1 in commercial and backyard poultry, wild bird populations, dairy cattle, and other susceptible mammals.14 Outbreak control measures primarily involve the depopulation of infected poultry flocks to prevent further spread.32 APHIS also provides substantial financial assistance and biosecurity support to poultry and dairy producers to mitigate losses and enhance on-farm protective measures.27The CDC leads the human public health response. This encompasses active surveillance for human cases, including monitoring individuals with known exposures to infected animals, and utilizing existing influenza surveillance networks like FluSurv-NET to detect any unusual activity.23 The CDC conducts laboratory testing for H5N1 in human samples, performs viral genomic sequencing, and undertakes risk assessments to inform public health strategy.23 Extensive guidance is provided to the general public, healthcare providers, and laboratories on prevention, diagnosis, and management of H5N1.23The FDA focuses on the safety of the U.S. food supply. This includes conducting research on the inactivation of the H5N1 virus in milk and dairy products, confirming the effectiveness of pasteurization.13 The FDA also issues guidance for dairy processors and pet food manufacturers concerning H5N1 risks and mitigation.61Key regulatory measures implemented include the USDA's Federal Orders requiring H5N1 testing for interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle and mandating reporting of positive results.32 The National Milk Testing Strategy further enhances surveillance in the dairy sector.32 An adaptive component of the surveillance strategy is the incorporation of H5 avian influenza A virus testing into the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS).24 While interpretation of wastewater data is complex as it cannot definitively distinguish between human and animal sources, it provides a broad, community-level indicator of viral circulation that can complement other surveillance methods and potentially identify areas requiring more targeted investigation.Significant investments are also being made in research and development, including efforts to advance animal and human vaccine candidates.27 The scale of financial commitment, such as the USDA's allocation of over $1 billion for the HPAI response 27, underscores the perceived high economic and potential public health threat, particularly following the virus's jump to dairy cattle. This level of intervention reflects an urgent attempt to control a rapidly evolving epizootic.While rapid outbreak control measures like culling are essential for limiting viral spread, there is an inherent tension with the scientific desire to study naturally exposed or potentially resistant animals. This was evident in the debate surrounding the B.C. ostrich farm 4 and is implicitly relevant to the U.S. situation with massive poultry culls and widespread cattle infections. The imperative for swift depopulation can sometimes conflict with valuable opportunities to research natural infection dynamics, host resistance mechanisms, and viral evolution in real-time within these large animal populations, a persistent challenge in managing fast-moving epizootics.IV. Comparative Analysis and Transboundary ConsiderationsA. Contrasting National Epidemiological LandscapesWhile both Canada and the United States grapple with HPAI H5N1, notable differences exist in their respective epidemiological situations as of May 2025. The most striking divergence lies in the dairy cattle sector. The U.S. is experiencing widespread H5N1 infection in its dairy herds, with 1,070 herds across 17 states affected by late May 2025.23 In stark contrast, Canada has reported no confirmed cases of H5N1 in its dairy cattle population, a status maintained despite extensive and proactive surveillance, including widespread testing of raw milk samples.7 This significant difference, despite the interconnected agricultural systems and shared ecosystems of the two countries, suggests that either the specific transmission dynamics facilitating efficient spread within U.S. dairies are not yet replicated in Canada, that Canadian biosecurity enhancements and surveillance have been preemptively effective in preventing establishment, or that subtle viral or host factors may be at play.Both nations continue to experience H5N1 outbreaks in their poultry sectors. However, the scale of these outbreaks is vastly larger in the United States, both in terms of the number of birds affected (over 171 million in the U.S. compared to approximately 14.5 million in Canada since the start of their respective outbreak waves) and the number of infected premises.1 This disparity likely reflects differences in the overall scale of their poultry industries, variations in the intensity of viral pressure from wild bird migratory routes, diverse farm management and housing systems, and potentially differences in reporting or detection efficiencies.Regarding human health, both countries have reported sporadic human cases of H5N1. The U.S. has recorded a higher number of cases (70 since April 2024 25), a significant portion of which are linked to exposure to infected dairy cattleâ€”an exposure route not yet relevant in Canada. Canada has reported one domestically acquired human case, linked to poultry exposure, which notably involved a virus strain with a mammalian adaptation marker.11Detections of H5N1 in wild bird populations are common in both countries, with diverse avian species affected.3 Similarly, various wild mammal species have tested positive in both nations, including foxes in Canada and a more extensive list of species in the U.S..14 Surveillance of these wildlife reservoirs is actively conducted by the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) and USDA APHIS.Table 3: Confirmed Human H5N1 Cases in Canada and the United States (2024-May 2025)

Sources: 6B. Transboundary Transmission Risks and Bilateral CooperationThe extensive shared border, interconnected ecosystems, and significant agricultural trade between Canada and the United States create inherent transboundary risks for H5N1 transmission. Migratory bird flyways traverse both countries, meaning that wild birds carrying the H5N1 virus regularly cross the border, posing a continuous and largely uncontrollable risk of viral exchange and introduction into new areas.3The movement of live animals, animal products, farm equipment, and personnel across the border, although subject to regulation, also presents potential pathways for viral transmission. The CFIA, for example, implements restrictions on the import of certain U.S. bird by-products due to HPAI concerns.1 Conversely, the U.S. relies on Canada for a portion of its egg supply, with Canadian eggs constituting over 40% of all U.S. egg imports in 2023.62 This economic interdependence means that outbreaks in one country can have direct supply and market implications for the other.Given these factors, robust bilateral cooperation on H5N1 surveillance, timely and transparent data sharing, and coordinated response strategies are essential for effective management of transboundary risks. Both Canada and the United States participate in international reporting mechanisms, such as to WOAH 10, and engage in scientific collaboration, as evidenced by the involvement of researchers from both countries in initiatives like the Global Virus Network study.2 The emergence of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle has undoubtedly heightened Canadian vigilance and biosecurity measures for its own dairy sector, demonstrating a reactive adaptation based on a neighboring country's adverse experience. This underscores how transboundary disease events can, and should, drive preemptive policy and surveillance enhancements in connected nations.V. Key Scientific Developments and Emerging Research (North America Focus)A. Viral Evolution, Genetic Clades, and Mutations of ConcernThe H5N1 avian influenza virus circulating in North America belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b, which initially spread from Eurasia and Africa, reaching the continent in 2021.10 Since its introduction, the virus has undergone further evolution. In the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak, the initial genotype identified was B3.13. However, a distinct genotype, D1.1â€”which was the predominant H5N1 genotype in North American wild bird flyways during the fall and winter of 2024-2025â€”was subsequently confirmed in infected cattle.33 Further genetic diversification is evident, as the virus isolated from a human case in Ohio, linked to poultry or dairy exposure, was identified as clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.3.25 Both the D1.1 and D1.3 genotypes are understood to have originated from an A3 genotype H5N1 virus that was introduced to North America in 2022 and subsequently reassorted with endemic North American wild bird avian influenza viruses.25 This active process of reassortment with local AIVs, leading to new genotypes circulating across multiple host species (poultry, wild birds, dairy cattle), signifies ongoing genetic exchange and adaptation. Such reassortment events can result in viruses with novel characteristics, potentially affecting host range, virulence, or transmissibility.Of particular concern are specific viral mutations associated with enhanced adaptation to mammalian hosts. The E627K mutation in the PB2 gene, known to increase viral replication efficiency in mammalian cells, has been detected in the virus from the Canadian human case 11 and in viruses from human cases in Wyoming and Nevada in the U.S..51 The repeated, independent emergence or selection of this mutation in viruses infecting humans is a significant molecular signal warranting close monitoring, as it may indicate an increased zoonotic potential or a greater likelihood of causing symptomatic human infection. While the virus from the Ohio human case did not, at the time of analysis, show markers that would impact antiviral effectiveness or existing candidate vaccine viruses, nor changes for better mammalian adaptation 25, the dynamic nature of influenza virus evolution necessitates continuous surveillance. Recent phylogenetic research has also raised concerns that even a single mutation in the H5N1 strain currently affecting dairy cattle could be sufficient to allow for more efficient binding to human-type receptors.39Despite these evolutionary changes, current assessments indicate that the H5N1 viruses circulating in the U.S. remain susceptible to available FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications.51 However, given the rapid mutation rate of influenza viruses and the vast scale of viral replication occurring in infected animal populations, the potential for antiviral resistance to emerge remains a constant concern, mandating ongoing genomic surveillance linked with antiviral susceptibility testing.B. Advances in Understanding Interspecies Transmission DynamicsThe H5N1 epizootic in North America, particularly the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak since March 2024 32, has provided new insights into the virus's capacity for interspecies transmission. While the initial jump into dairy cattle likely originated from an avian source, subsequent spread between dairy farms appears to be driven by factors such as the movement of cattle, contaminated equipment, and personnel, rather than continuous reintroduction from migratory birds.32 This points to the establishment of efficient intra-mammalian transmission routes, potentially involving fomites like milking equipment or shared environments, which are less characterized for H5N1 than direct avian-to-mammal spillover.The consumption of contaminated raw animal products has been clearly identified as a transmission pathway to other mammals. H5N1 infections in domestic cats have been directly linked to their ingestion of unpasteurized milk or colostrum from infected cows, or contaminated raw meat pet foods.33 This finding has significant implications, not only for pet safety but also as a parallel concern for potential human exposure through consumption of raw dairy products, despite the protection afforded by pasteurization in the commercial milk supply.13The first likely mammal-to-human transmission of H5N1 was reported in a Texas dairy worker 14, highlighting the zoonotic risk associated with this new mammalian reservoir. While cats are generally considered dead-end hosts for avian influenza 46, the sheer number of susceptible species now documented as infected raises concerns about the virus's adaptability.Mathematical modeling studies, such as a recent publication in Nature Communications (May 2025), suggest that H5N1 is likely spreading more extensively and often undetected within U.S. dairy herds than official reports indicate. The study posited that current intervention strategies, primarily focused on pre-movement testing of a limited number of animals, are insufficient to control the epidemic and predicted continued outbreaks in 2025.39 This suggests a pressing need for enhanced surveillance methods (e.g., more comprehensive herd testing, better interpretation of wastewater data) and potentially more stringent biosecurity measures or movement controls within the dairy industry to manage this hidden spread. The overarching concern, as highlighted by entities like the Global Virus Network, is that the continued circulation and adaptation of H5N1 in animal populations, particularly mammals, increases the opportunities for the virus to acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, potentially sparking a pandemic.2C. Progress in Vaccine Development and Antiviral EfficacyEfforts to develop and deploy effective vaccines against H5N1 are underway for both animal and human populations, alongside continuous monitoring of antiviral drug efficacy.In Canada, the CFIA and Health Canada are actively supporting the development of animal vaccines.9 In the United States, the USDA announced in January 2025 an update to its stockpile of vaccines for chickens, with an updated version developed by Zoetis.30 The USDA is also investing up to $100 million in research encompassing vaccines and other countermeasures.27 A notable advancement is a nanoparticle-based H5N1 vaccine candidate, targeting the currently circulating clade 2.3.4.4b. Developed by POP Biotechnologies in collaboration with the University at Buffalo, this vaccine demonstrated 100% protection in preclinical trials in mice and is being pursued for both veterinary and human medical applications. Results were published in April 2025 in Cell Biomaterials.63 Such nanoparticle platforms may offer advantages in terms of speed and adaptability of production compared to traditional egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing methods, which could be crucial for responding to evolving viral strains or a pandemic emergency. However, the widespread implementation of animal vaccines, particularly for poultry in major exporting nations like the U.S., faces significant hurdles. These include concerns that vaccination could mask infections (making surveillance more difficult), lead to international trade restrictions from countries that do not accept vaccinated poultry, and potentially drive viral evolution.30For human pandemic preparedness, both Canada and the U.S. maintain stockpiles of H5N1 vaccines. PHAC in Canada has purchased 500,000 doses.17 In the U.S., the CDC has indicated that existing candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) are expected to be effective against the H5N1 strains currently circulating, including the virus isolated from the recent Ohio human case.25 The current strategy focuses on ensuring these stockpiled vaccines match circulating strains and can be deployed if sustained human-to-human transmission emerges, rather than on preemptive mass vaccination campaigns, given the current low risk to the general public.Regarding antiviral treatments, currently available FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir, have been found to be effective against the H5N1 strains circulating in the U.S..25 These medications are recommended for the treatment of confirmed or suspected H5N1 infections in humans and can also be considered for post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals with significant unprotected exposures.51VI. Socio-Economic and Agricultural Sector ImpactsA. Impact on the North American Poultry and Egg IndustriesHPAI H5N1 has inflicted substantial economic damage on the North American poultry and egg industries, primarily through direct bird losses, depopulation measures, and subsequent market disruptions. In Canada, the CFIA's objectives include minimizing the financial impact on the poultry sector and maintaining crucial export markets 9, as outbreaks are known to cause "massive losses" to poultry stock.5The impact in the United States has been particularly severe, described as "unprecedented damage" to poultry flocks, which has directly contributed to record-high egg prices.34 With over 171.5 million poultry affected by May 2025 23, the supply chain for eggs has been significantly strained. This has translated into sharp increases in retail egg prices: U.S. consumers saw prices rise by 8.4% in December 2024, 13.8% in January 2025, and 12.5% in February 2025. By March 2025, the retail price of eggs was 60.4% higher than in March 2024, with an overall increase of 57.6% projected for the entirety of 2025 compared to the previous year.34 Other reports indicated that egg prices soared by 37% in 2024, and in January 2025 alone, prices jumped by more than 22%, reaching an all-time high of $7.09 per dozen in some areas, with projections suggesting prices could approach $10 per dozen by the end of the year.62 The high cost of eggs has become one of the most visible societal impacts of the H5N1 epizootic.30 This situation clearly demonstrates the vulnerability of concentrated food supply chains to animal diseases, where outbreaks in a specialized agricultural sector can rapidly translate into widespread economic pressure on consumers and affect food security for a staple protein source.The sheer scale of poultry losses has prompted discussions about control strategies beyond culling, such as vaccination. However, as previously noted, the adoption of widespread poultry vaccination in major export-oriented industries like that of the U.S. is hindered by concerns over potential trade barriers from importing countries that do not accept vaccinated poultry.30 This creates a complex dilemma between immediate disease control through established (though costly) methods and exploring potentially more sustainable long-term management strategies that might have adverse trade consequences.B. Consequences for the Dairy Sector (particularly in the US)The emergence of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle since March 2024 has introduced a new dimension of economic risk, threatening significant losses to the dairy industry and potentially leading to increased milk prices.34 Affected dairy farms experience direct economic consequences from clinical signs in their herds, which include notably reduced milk production and abnormal milk quality that must be discarded.32However, despite the widespread infection in U.S. dairy herds, the direct impact on retail milk prices for consumers has been relatively muted thus far. Dairy prices in March 2025 were reported to be 2.2% higher than in March 2024, and were actually projected to decrease by 0.8% across 2025 compared to 2024.34 This relative insulation of consumer milk prices, compared to the volatility seen in egg prices, may be attributable to several factors: the U.S. dairy herd is very large, the H5N1 infection in cattle typically causes temporary illness rather than high mortality 32, and milk from sick cows is diverted from the commercial supply.55 This contrasts sharply with the poultry industry, where entire infected flocks are depopulated, leading to immediate and often drastic supply shocks.The primary economic burden for H5N1-affected U.S. dairy farms currently stems from lost milk production, increased veterinary costs for supportive care and testing, and the expenses associated with implementing enhanced biosecurity measures.33 Animal mortality is not the main economic driver in the dairy context, unlike in poultry. USDA financial assistance programs for the dairy sector are consequently tailored to address these specific types of losses, offering compensation for discarded milk, veterinary expenses, and biosecurity planning.38In Canada, the dairy sector has thus far been spared direct impacts from H5N1, as no cases have been detected in Canadian dairy cattle.7 A key objective for the CFIA is to maintain Canada's dairy export markets, which relies on demonstrating continued freedom from the disease in its national herd.9C. Governmental Economic Support and Mitigation ProgramsGovernments in both Canada and the United States have allocated substantial financial resources to combat H5N1 and support affected agricultural sectors.In Canada, the federal government has committed $27.9 million for the 2024-2025 fiscal year to bolster the national H5N1 response. These funds are directed towards early detection, prevention, rapid response, minimizing financial impacts on producers, and supporting research efforts.9The United States has mobilized a significantly larger financial response, reflecting the scale of its outbreaks. The USDA is investing $1 billion in a comprehensive strategy to curb HPAI, protect the poultry industry, and alleviate pressure on egg prices.27 This extensive package includes $500 million for enhancing on-farm biosecurity, $400 million in financial relief for affected farmers, and $100 million for research and development of vaccines and other countermeasures.27 By late 2024, the total costs associated with the ongoing H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. had already exceeded $1.4 billion, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), encompassing compensation, indemnity payments, and other related expenses.34 Other reports indicate that the federal government had spent over $1.25 billion compensating farmers for their losses.62The USDA provides specific financial assistance programs for both poultry and dairy producers. For poultry farmers, this includes indemnity payments for depopulated flocks, with compensation rates periodically updated (e.g., increased to $16.94 per egg-laying bird in February 2025 34). For dairy producers affected by H5N1, USDA offers support for biosecurity planning and implementation, costs associated with sample collection and testing, veterinary expenses, procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for farm workers, heat treatment for disposal of contaminated milk, and compensation for a portion of lost milk production.29This substantial government expenditure in the U.S. serves a dual purpose: it aims to provide immediate financial relief to farmers to ensure the viability of their operations, and simultaneously, it seeks to incentivize the adoption of improved biosecurity measures to reduce the likelihood and impact of future outbreaks. The significant allocation towards biosecurity assessments and cost-sharing for facility upgrades indicates a strategic approach that combines direct aid with long-term prevention. However, the structure and implementation of these large-scale compensation programs can sometimes lead to unintended consequences or perceived inequities. For example, an Illinois family farm reportedly lost the entirety of its 3,000-hen flock to H5N1 in early 2025 but received only $2,500 in compensation because most of its birds were already dead upon the USDA's arrival to conduct culling.34 This case highlights how the specifics of indemnity calculationâ€”particularly if it primarily covers animals culled by authorities rather than those already lost to the diseaseâ€”can disproportionately affect smaller operations or those where the virus progresses with extreme rapidity, pointing to the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of support mechanisms to ensure they are both effective and equitable.VII. Public Health Preparedness, Prevention, and OutlookA. Comprehensive Risk Assessment for Human PopulationsPublic health agencies in both Canada and the United States conduct ongoing risk assessments for H5N1 avian influenza in human populations. The consensus is that while the virus poses a significant threat due to its pandemic potential, the current risk of infection to the general public in both countries remains low.17 This assessment is based on the absence of evidence for efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of the currently circulating H5N1 strains.17However, this low overall risk is not uniform across the population. For individuals with close or prolonged occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds, dairy cattle, or other animals, or to environments heavily contaminated by these animals, the risk of infection is considered significantly higherâ€”assessed as moderate to high by the U.S. CDC.17 This includes poultry workers, dairy farm workers, veterinarians, animal health responders, and individuals with backyard flocks.The primary public health concern associated with H5N1 is not widespread current infection in the general populace, but rather its pandemic potential.2 Influenza viruses are known for their capacity to mutate and reassort. If an H5N1 virus were to acquire the genetic changes necessary for efficient and sustained transmission among humans, it could trigger a global pandemic. Each instance of animal-to-human transmission provides an opportunity for the virus to further adapt to human hosts. The detection of viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation, such as the PB2 E627K substitution found in viruses from some human cases in both Canada and the U.S. 11, underscores this ongoing evolutionary pressure and the reason for heightened surveillance.B. Consolidated Prevention and Biosecurity Recommendations (General Public, Farmers, High-Risk Occupations)A cornerstone of the public health response is providing clear guidance on prevention and biosecurity. Recommendations from PHAC, CDC, and USDA are tailored to different groups:

General Public: The fundamental advice is to avoid direct contact with wild birds, sick or dead animals, and their feces or contaminated environments.21 Thorough cooking of all poultry, eggs, and meat is emphasized, as this kills the virus.21 Consumption of pasteurized dairy products is safe; raw (unpasteurized) milk and raw milk products should be avoided due to the risk of H5N1 and other pathogens.21 Practicing good hand hygiene (frequent washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer) is crucial.21 Pets should be kept away from wild birds, other wildlife, and their potentially contaminated environments; feeding pets raw milk or raw meat-based diets is discouraged, especially in areas with H5N1 activity.21


Farmers and Animal Workers (Poultry and Dairy): Strict adherence to on-farm biosecurity protocols is paramount.8 This includes measures such as controlling access to barns, dedicated clothing and footwear, regular cleaning and disinfection of premises and equipment, and preventing contact between domestic animals and wild birds or other wildlife.8 The use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)â€”including masks (preferably N95 respirators), eye protection, gloves, and coverallsâ€”is strongly recommended when handling potentially infected animals or working in contaminated environments.21 Sick animals should be isolated promptly.55 Farmers and workers should monitor their animal populations closely for any signs of HPAI and report suspected cases to veterinary authorities immediately.8 Receiving an annual seasonal influenza vaccination is also recommended for animal workers, not to protect against H5N1 directly, but to reduce the risk of co-infection with human and avian influenza viruses, which could facilitate viral reassortment.21


Hunters and Trappers: Individuals handling wild game, particularly birds, should take precautions during de-feathering, cleaning, and preparation. Thorough cooking of all wild game meat, organs, and eggs is essential to kill the H5N1 virus and other potential pathogens.21

The emphasis on biosecurity for farms is critical for preventing the introduction and spread of H5N1 in domestic animal populations. However, the ubiquitous presence of the virus in wild bird reservoirs and the numerous potential pathways for viral entry onto farms (e.g., contaminated feed, water, equipment, personnel, pests) make achieving infallible biosecurity an ongoing and formidable challenge. This reality underscores the need for continuous improvement, regular auditing of biosecurity plans, and exploration of new technologies or strategies to bolster farm defenses.The strong public health advisories against the consumption of raw milk and the feeding of raw meat-based diets to pets, specifically due to H5N1 risk 21, are scientifically grounded. These recommendations align with broader food safety principles but may encounter resistance from individuals or groups who advocate for such raw products, presenting a public health communication challenge to effectively convey these specific H5N1-related risks.Table 4: Key H5N1 Prevention and Biosecurity Recommendations Summary (North America)

Sources: Consolidated from 8C. Future Outlook, Pandemic Preparedness, and Research PrioritiesThe H5N1 avian influenza situation in North America is dynamic, and the long-term outlook suggests that this virus will likely remain an endemic or frequently re-emerging zoonotic threat. This necessitates sustained, adaptable, and well-funded "One Health" preparedness efforts, integrating human, domestic animal, and wildlife health sectors. The virus's deep entrenchment in global wild bird populations 10, its demonstrated ability to infect an expanding range of mammalian species 14, and its continuous genetic evolution 11 all point to a persistent challenge. As advocated by international bodies like the Global Virus Network, future preparedness must assume ongoing risk and therefore requires long-term investment in robust surveillance systems, rapid response capabilities, continued research into viral adaptation and countermeasures, and strong public health infrastructure.2A critical aspect of pandemic preparedness is understanding the specific molecular changes that would enable the H5N1 virus to transmit efficiently and sustainably among humans. While general markers of mammalian adaptation, such as the PB2 E627K mutation, are known and monitored 11, the precise constellation of genetic changes required for pandemic emergence is not fully elucidated. The establishment of H5N1 in large, managed mammal populations, such as U.S. dairy cattle 23, and its sporadic detection in pigs 10â€”a known "mixing vessel" for influenza virusesâ€”provide new and concerning environments where such adaptive evolution could occur.Consequently, key research priorities include:
Viral Evolution and Adaptation: Continued genomic surveillance of H5N1 viruses from human, domestic animal, and wildlife sources to track mutations, reassortment events, and the emergence of traits associated with increased transmissibility or pathogenicity in mammals, including humans.
Interspecies Transmission Dynamics: Further investigation into the mechanisms by which H5N1 transmits between different animal species, particularly from birds to mammals, and between mammals (e.g., within dairy herds). Understanding the role of intermediate hosts is crucial.
Vaccine and Antiviral Efficacy: Ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of current and candidate vaccines (for both animals and humans) against evolving H5N1 strains, and vigilant monitoring for the emergence of antiviral resistance. Development of novel, broadly protective, or rapidly adaptable vaccine platforms remains a high priority.
Improved Diagnostics: Development and deployment of rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests for use in diverse settings, including farms, clinics, and laboratories.
Risk Factor Analysis: Research to better understand the factors that contribute to severe disease in humans infected with H5N1, and the determinants of susceptibility to infection.
Predictive Modeling: Enhancing and utilizing mathematical models to forecast outbreak scenarios, identify high-risk areas or practices, and evaluate the potential impact of different intervention strategies, such as the Canadian bird migration modeling 17 and the U.S. dairy cattle transmission model.39
The continued transmission of H5N1 in animal populations and the occurrence of sporadic human cases serve as constant reminders that the opportunity for the virus to adapt further to humans persists.17 This underscores the imperative for a proactive and scientifically informed approach to managing this complex global health threat.VIII. ConclusionThe H5N1 avian influenza situation in Canada and the United States as of May 2025 is characterized by its complexity, dynamism, and significant implications for animal health, the agricultural economy, and public health. Wild bird populations across North America remain deeply affected, serving as a persistent reservoir for the virus and driving recurrent outbreaks in domestic poultry in both nations. While both countries face this challenge, the scale of poultry industry impact is notably larger in the U.S.A critical divergence in the epizootic is the widespread emergence and transmission of H5N1 within U.S. dairy cattle herds since early 2024. This novel development has introduced new transmission dynamics, expanded the range of mammals known to be susceptible under field conditions, and created new pathways for human exposure. To date, Canada has not detected H5N1 in its dairy cattle, a status maintained through extensive surveillance.Sporadic human infections, though rare, continue to occur in both countries, primarily linked to direct contact with infected animals. The detection of viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation in some human and animal isolates warrants continuous vigilance, as the potential for H5N1 to evolve and gain the ability to transmit efficiently among humans remains the foremost long-term public health concern. Current risk assessments categorize the threat to the general public as low, but elevated for those with direct animal exposures.Both Canada and the United States have mounted substantial responses, involving significant financial investment and multi-agency collaboration. These efforts encompass robust surveillance in animal and human populations, outbreak control measures, promotion of biosecurity, public health guidance, and strategic investment in research and countermeasures, including vaccine development and stockpiling.The path forward requires sustained commitment to a One Health approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. Enhanced bilateral and international collaboration, continued investment in scientific research to understand viral evolution and transmission, and adaptive preparedness strategies are crucial. The H5N1 virus has repeatedly demonstrated its capacity to surprise and adapt, underscoring the need for unflagging vigilance and a proactive stance to mitigate the multifaceted risks it poses to North America and the global community.
