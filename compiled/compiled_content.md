Okay, I will provide an audit and a *best estimate* for each line item of economic damage to Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (UOF), based on the information provided.

**Crucial Disclaimer:** This is an *estimation and analysis* based solely on the textual evidence you've supplied. It is **not** a formal financial audit, appraisal, or market valuation conducted by a qualified professional accountant, appraiser, or industry expert. The figures for future lost income and the intrinsic value of unique genetics are particularly speculative and are provided to illustrate potential scale based on the narrative presented. Actual financial records and expert valuations would be required for a definitive assessment.

**Economic Damage Audit & Estimation for Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (UOF)**

**I. Direct Loss of Biological Assets (The Ostrich Flock)**

This is the most tangible loss, though valuations differ significantly.

*   **A. CFIA Compensation Model (Maximum Potential Payout from CFIA):**
    *   Number of birds under cull order: ~400
    *   Maximum CFIA compensation per ostrich: $3,000 (Decision, para [85])
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (A):** 400 birds * $3,000/bird = **$1,200,000 CAD**
        *   *Note:* This is the CFIA's *maximum potential* payout. The farm disputes this as a full valuation and questions if they'd receive it given their legal challenge (Official Statement).

*   **B. UOF's Perceived/Intrinsic Value of Flock (Based on Specialization):**
    *   Assumptions for estimation: Given the research focus and 30+ years of breeding:
        *   Let's conservatively assume 15% (60 birds) are prime antibody-producing hens.
        *   Let's assume 15% (60 birds) are prime breeding roosters.
        *   Let's assume the remaining 70% (280 birds) are younger stock/other breeders with a value higher than generic but lower than prime research animals (e.g., an average of $5,000).
    *   Prime Antibody Hens: 60 hens * $93,000/hen (UOF stated value) = $5,580,000
    *   Prime Breeding Roosters: 60 roosters * $7,500/rooster (UOF stated value) = $450,000
    *   Other Stock: 280 birds * $5,000/bird (estimated average) = $1,400,000
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (B - UOF's Perceived Direct Flock Value):** $5,580,000 + $450,000 + $1,400,000 = **$7,430,000 CAD**
        *   *Note:* The "decades of genetic investment" (Decision, para [1]) is an additional intrinsic value layered onto this, extremely difficult to quantify but immense.

**II. Loss of Income Streams (Current & Future)**

*   **A. Lost Future Income from Antibody (IgY) Research & Commercialization:**
    *   Described as "lucrative" (Decision, para [26]) and UOF's "primary commercial focus" since 2020. Supported by HHS letter for significant research value.
    *   *Estimation:* This is highly speculative. A conservative estimate for *lost potential net revenue/grant funding* over the next 5-10 years, if their research path was successful, could reasonably be in the low-to-mid millions. Let's use a conservative estimate for a 5-year projection, assuming modest success based on expressed potential.
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (II.A):** **$2,500,000 CAD** (Highly Speculative)

*   **B. Lost Income from Breeding Stock Sales:**
    *   An existing revenue stream (Decision, para [13]).
    *   *Estimation:* If they sold, for example, 10 breeding pairs annually at an average of $10,000/pair (conservative given individual rooster/hen values), that's $100,000/year. Loss over a 2-3 year recovery/rebuild period (if even possible).
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (II.B):** **$250,000 CAD**

*   **C. Lost Income from Agri-Tourism & Other Ancillary Products:**
    *   Offered tours, limited meat processing (Decision, para [13], [26]).
    *   *Estimation:* A smaller, but consistent income. Perhaps $20,000 - $30,000 annually. Loss over a 2-3 year period.
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (II.C):** **$60,000 CAD**

**III. Legal, Administrative, and Punitive Costs**

*   **A. UOF's Incurred Legal Fees (to date):**
    *   Stated as "over a hundred thousand dollars in debt legally, still" (SaveOurOstriches.com Donate Page, likely as of Apr/May 2025). Includes costs for judicial review and now initiating an appeal.
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (III.A):** **$150,000 CAD** (and likely growing with the appeal)

*   **B. CFIA Legal Costs Awarded Against UOF:**
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (III.B):** **$15,000 CAD** (Decision, para [271])

*   **C. Potential CFIA Fines:**
    *   Two $10,000 fines mentioned (Official Statement, SaveOurOstriches.com).
    *   **Estimated Line Item Damage (III.C):** **$20,000 CAD** (Outcome of challenge is pending)

**IV. Operational Disruption & Wind-Down Costs (Illustrative)**

*   Costs associated with prolonged quarantine, enhanced biosecurity measures beyond normal operations, time spent on legal/PR efforts instead of farm development, emotional distress, potential costs of humane euthanasia and disposal if the cull proceeds (if not fully covered or if compensation is reduced).
*   *Estimation:* This is very difficult. Assigning a nominal figure for significant disruption over ~6 months.
*   **Estimated Line Item Damage (IV):** **$50,000 CAD** (Highly Conservative Placeholder)

**Will This Destroy Their Farm?**

**Yes, based on these estimates and the information provided, the cumulative economic damages have a very high probability of destroying Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. as a viable, research-focused operation, and potentially as any kind of operation.**

*   **Loss of Core Business:** The cull would eradicate their primary assets and the foundation of their unique research-based business model. Replicating 30+ years of genetic development is practically impossible.
*   **Financial Ruin:** The estimated quantifiable losses (around $9.275 million, using UOF's flock valuation perspective, before even considering the value of the physical farm itself) vastly outweigh the maximum potential CFIA compensation ($1.2 million). This leaves a deficit of over $8 million, plus existing legal debts ($>100k) and awarded costs ($15k). Such a financial chasm would be insurmountable for most small family farms.
*   **Inability to Rebuild the Specialized Operation:** Even if they received full CFIA compensation and somehow cleared debts, they could not simply "buy" a new flock with the same genetic and research history. Their niche was built on decades of specific work.
*   **Age of Owners:** As mentioned previously, starting over is likely not feasible for the owners given their stage in life.

**How Much is the Farm Itself Worth (Beyond the Flock)?**

The documents state UOF is a "65-acre operation" (Decision, para [13]). **The market value of this land, along with any buildings, specialized infrastructure for ostriches, and equipment, is not provided in the texts.**

To estimate this, one would need:
*   Location details for land value comparison (Edgewood, B.C. rural property).
*   Inventory and valuation of farm buildings (barns, shelters, research facilities if any).
*   Inventory and valuation of specialized equipment (fencing, incubators, lab equipment if any).

Without this, we can only state that the **physical farm assets represent an additional, significant economic value that would be lost if the business collapses and they are forced to sell under duress or abandon the property.** This could easily range from hundreds of thousands to potentially over a million dollars depending on the specifics, in addition to the business/flock value loss.

In conclusion, the multifaceted economic damages – from the direct loss of an invaluable flock and its future research income, to crippling legal costs and the potential loss of the physical farm itself – paint a picture of almost certain financial devastation for Universal Ostrich Farms if the cull proceeds and compensation remains at the standard statutory maximum.

## Universal Ostrich Farms: Flock Status and The Argument Triangle (As of May 27, 2025)

**Current Flock Status:**

As of May 27, 2025, the approximately 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms (UOF) in Edgewood, B.C., are **alive but remain under a CFIA-ordered cull directive.**

*   **Health:** The farm consistently reports that the flock has been healthy, with no further deaths or signs of avian influenza since January 15, 2025.
*   **Legal Standing:**
    *   The CFIA's "Notice to Dispose" (cull order) from December 31, 2024, and the subsequent "Exemption Denial" from January 10, 2025, were **upheld as reasonable and procedurally fair** by Justice Russel W. Zinn of the Federal Court on May 13, 2025.
    *   Universal Ostrich Farms, through spokesperson Katie Pasitney, **confirmed on May 26, 2025, that an appeal against Justice Zinn's decision has been filed.**
    *   According to Pasitney, there is currently **no court-ordered stay of execution** related to the appeal. However, an **agreement is in place with the CFIA to temporarily pause enforcement** of the cull order, pending UOF's expedited motion for a stay. The ostriches' immediate fate hinges on the success of this stay motion.
*   **External Pressures/Support:**
    *   The Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) voted on May 15, 2025, to **refuse ostrich carcasses at its landfills** until the CFIA re-tests the currently healthy birds and makes results public.
    *   A significant letter dated May 23, 2025, from the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the NIH Director, and the FDA Commissioner was sent to the CFIA, **advocating for the preservation of the flock for scientific research** due to its unique H5N1 exposure and survival.

---

**Main Arguments & Motivations of Key Parties:**

**1. Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (UOF) - The Applicant Farmers**

*   **Their Main Arguments/Position:**
    *   The flock is currently healthy, has likely developed natural immunity to the specific H5N1 strain, and poses minimal ongoing risk.
    *   The ostriches possess unique and invaluable scientific and genetic value, particularly for researching H5N1 immune responses, antibody development, and potential therapeutics. This value was inadequately assessed or narrowly interpreted by the CFIA under its "rare and valuable genetics" exemption criteria.
    *   The CFIA's "Stamping-Out Policy" is an outdated, inflexible "one-size-fits-all" approach primarily designed for commercial poultry and is being misapplied to their unique, long-lived research flock of ostriches.
    *   The CFIA acted with procedural unfairness (e.g., not waiting for its own commissioned report on ostriches and AI before denying the exemption, providing misleading or incomplete information about exemption criteria).
    *   Culling the entire flock is a disproportionate measure given the current health status, the passage of time since the outbreak, and the immense loss of scientific potential.
    *   Farmers should have the right to conduct independent testing and pursue treatment options for their animals, rather than facing immediate cull orders based on limited initial testing.
    *   They are advocating for policy reform to allow for more nuanced, science-driven approaches to animal disease outbreaks, especially in unique research contexts.

*   **Why They Are Doing What They're Doing (Motivations):**
    *   **Preserve Their Animals:** Deep emotional connection to animals they've raised for decades, some for over 30 years.
    *   **Protect Livelihood & Research:** Their farm has pivoted to research, and the flock is central to this and future scientific collaborations (e.g., with Kyoto University, and now potentially U.S. health agencies).
    *   **Scientific Advancement:** Genuine belief that their flock offers a unique opportunity to study H5N1, potentially benefiting animal and human health globally.
    *   **Fight for Farmers' Rights:** They see their case as a precedent-setting battle for the rights of farmers against what they perceive as government overreach and outdated, inflexible policies.
    *   **Belief in Natural Immunity:** Strong conviction that their surviving ostriches demonstrate natural resilience that should be studied, not destroyed.

**2. Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) - The Respondent & Regulator**

*   **Their Main Arguments/Position (as upheld by Justice Zinn):**
    *   Mandated by the *Health of Animals Act* to prevent and control the spread of reportable animal diseases like HPAI to protect animal health, public health, and Canada's agricultural economy (especially the poultry industry and international trade).
    *   The "Stamping-Out Policy," as operationalized in the 2022 Event Response Plan (ERP), is a scientifically-based, internationally recognized (WOAH-aligned) and reasonable approach to eradicate HPAI.
    *   A positive H5 RRT-PCR test result from an accredited lab is a valid trigger for implementing the policy in a non-index case.
    *   UOF did not meet the strict, established criteria for an exemption from depopulation (i.e., failed to prove the existence of a distinct epidemiological unit free from exposure risk and did not provide sufficient evidence of "rare and valuable genetics" as defined by CFIA policy).
    *   Biosecurity conditions observed at UOF were deemed inadequate, posing an ongoing risk of viral persistence, mutation, and spread to other poultry, wild birds, and potentially humans.
    *   Their decisions regarding the Notice to Dispose and the Exemption Denial were procedurally fair and reasonable based on the information available *at the time* (December 2024/January 2025).

*   **Why They Are Doing What They're Doing (Motivations):**
    *   **Statutory Duty:** To fulfill their legal mandate under the *Health of Animals Act*.
    *   **Disease Control:** To prevent the further spread of HPAI, which can devastate poultry populations and has zoonotic potential.
    *   **Economic Protection:** To safeguard Canada's multi-billion dollar poultry industry and its international trade status, which can be severely impacted by HPAI outbreaks.
    *   **Adherence to Policy:** To consistently apply established national and international animal health policies and protocols.
    *   **Precautionary Principle:** To act decisively to mitigate potential risks, even under conditions of some scientific uncertainty regarding this specific novel strain in ostriches.

**3. Justice Russel W. Zinn (Federal Court) - The Reviewing Judge**

*   **His Main Arguments/Position (from his decision):**
    *   The Court's role in a judicial review is not to re-hear the case or substitute its own opinion for that of the expert agency (CFIA), but to assess if the CFIA's decision was reasonable and procedurally fair based on the evidence *before the CFIA at the time of the decision*.
    *   The CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy is, in itself, reasonable in law and consistent with the objectives of the *Health of Animals Act*.
    *   The CFIA's application of its policy and exemption criteria to UOF's specific circumstances was found to be reasonable and procedurally fair *given the information CFIA possessed in December 2024 and January 2025*.
    *   Significant deference is owed to specialized administrative bodies like the CFIA regarding scientific and technical matters.
    *   The CFIA's failure to wait for Dr. French's literature review before issuing the Exemption Denial was not considered a "fatal flaw" that would render the decision unreasonable, as the judge concluded it likely wouldn't have changed the outcome based on other factors.
    *   No legitimate expectation for a specific outcome or procedural approach was created by CFIA's communications with UOF.

*   **Why He Ruled As He Did (Motivations):**
    *   **Application of Administrative Law:** To correctly apply the legal principles of judicial review, including the Vavilov standard of reasonableness and procedural fairness.
    *   **Respect for Separation of Powers:** To uphold the legislative choice of granting decision-making power on technical matters to specialized administrative agencies.
    *   **Upholding Legal Authority:** To ensure the CFIA acted within the bounds of its statutory authority.
    *   **Focus on the Record:** To base the review strictly on the evidence and record that was before the CFIA when its decisions were made, avoiding hindsight.

**4. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), NIH, FDA - International Scientific Interest**

*   **Their Main Arguments/Position (from their letter):**
    *   The UOF ostrich flock holds "significant value" for longitudinal research into H5N1's natural history, immune longevity, antibody levels, cellular immunity, and potential therapeutics.
    *   Culling the flock now, months after the initial infection and with observed recovery, "will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds" and is a "potentially disproportionate measure."
    *   Given that H5N1 is endemic in wild bird populations, efforts to extirpate it by culling specific domestic flocks like this one may be "fruitless" in the grand scheme.
    *   They propose international collaboration between the U.S. and Canadian governments to devise "more nuanced and thoughtful protocols" for controlling avian influenza outbreaks, particularly in unique research flocks.
    *   The destruction of these animals would represent a loss of valuable genetic stock and disrupt important scientific opportunities.

*   **Why They Are Intervening (Motivations):**
    *   **Scientific Advancement:** To seize a unique opportunity to study a controlled, naturally exposed flock with potential immunity to H5N1, which could yield critical insights for human and animal health.
    *   **Pandemic Preparedness:** To gather data that could inform strategies for potential future H5N1 epidemics or pandemics.
    *   **International Collaboration:** To foster cooperative research on a shared global health threat.
    *   **Advocacy for Nuanced Policy:** To encourage a shift from blanket stamping-out policies towards more tailored approaches when significant scientific value is present.

This complex situation involves a clash of statutory mandates, economic concerns, animal welfare, profound scientific interest, and a family's passionate fight for their farm and the future of their unique flock. The appeal by UOF, bolstered by the significant international scientific endorsement, will be a critical next step.

## Wings of Contention: International Scientific Interest and Farmer Rights Fuel Appeal in BC Ostrich Cull Case

**Edgewood, B.C.** – In the serene Kootenay region of British Columbia, a 65-acre family-run ostrich farm has become the epicenter of a legal and ethical maelstrom with international implications. Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (UOF), managed by Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski for over 30 years, is appealing a Federal Court decision that upheld the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) order to euthanize their flock of approximately 400 ostriches following an H5N1 avian influenza detection. The case, already a poignant struggle, has been significantly amplified by a direct intervention from top U.S. health officials highlighting the flock's unique scientific value, while the farm itself, through spokesperson Katie Pasitney, frames its ongoing battle as a fight for broader agricultural policy reform and farmers' rights.

**The Farm, Its Keepers, and a Shift to Science:**

Universal Ostrich Farms has a long history of selective breeding. Around 2020, its focus significantly shifted towards scientific research, particularly the extraction of immunoglobulin Y (IgY) antibodies from ostrich eggs. This work, involving collaborations with entities like Kyoto Prefectural University, aims to develop diagnostics or therapeutics for human viruses. To its owners, the flock represents not just decades of dedication, but a living bio-resource of immense potential – a claim now strongly echoed by international health authorities.

**The Outbreak and the CFIA's Swift Action:**

The crisis began in early December 2024 when, after reported exposure to wild ducks, some UOF ostriches exhibited respiratory symptoms. Following an anonymous tip, the CFIA intervened on December 28, 2024. Swab samples from two deceased birds on December 30 returned positive for H5 avian influenza the next day. Within 41 minutes of this preliminary result, the CFIA issued a "Notice to Dispose," mandating the destruction of the entire flock by February 1, 2025, under its "Stamping-Out Policy." Subsequent tests confirmed HPAI H5N1.

**A Plea for Exemption and a Judicial Setback:**

UOF sought an exemption, arguing their flock was a "distinct epidemiological unit" with "rare and valuable poultry genetics." They highlighted their breeding program and the belief that many birds had developed natural immunity, especially as the last flu-related death was on January 15, 2025, with the remaining flock reportedly healthy since.

On January 10, 2025, the CFIA denied the exemption, citing biosecurity concerns and finding insufficient proof of genetic rarity under its traditional criteria, which UOF argued overlooked the "acquired scientific rarity" of a potentially immune, research-critical flock.

UOF pursued a judicial review. On May 13, 2025, Justice Russel W. Zinn of the Federal Court dismissed their applications. He emphasized that his review was confined to the CFIA's reasonableness and procedural fairness based *only on the information available to the agency at the time of its decisions (December 2024/January 2025)*. Justice Zinn found the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy reasonable and consistent with its mandate and international obligations.

**The Game-Changing HHS Letter and Its Impact:**

The landscape of the case dramatically shifted post-decision with a letter dated May 23, 2025, to the CFIA President from the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This unprecedented intervention has profound implications:
1.  **Validation of Unique Scientific Value:** The HHS letter powerfully corroborates UOF's central claim, stating, "we believe there is significant value in studying this population" for H5N1 natural history, immune longevity, and therapeutic potential. This challenges the CFIA's potentially narrow interpretation of "value."
2.  **Reframing "Public Interest" and "International Obligations":** The HHS letter introduces a compelling *countervailing international public interest* – the advancement of global scientific understanding of H5N1, advocated by a major trading partner. It proposes international collaboration to *study*, not cull, the ostriches.
3.  **Questioning Proportionality and Necessity of Culling:** The U.S. officials explicitly state that culling the flock now, months after infection and with observed recovery, "will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds" and is a "potentially disproportionate measure."

**UOF's Appeal and Broader Fight: Current Status and Path Forward**

Universal Ostrich Farms, as confirmed by Katie Pasitney in a Facebook update on May 26, 2025, has officially filed an appeal against Justice Zinn's decision. Pasitney clarified the current situation: "No order halting enforcement or no court order halting enforcement has been issued. What they have agreed upon is that if we get our stay motion which is next approved on an expedited... timely manner... then they will halt the order." This indicates a temporary pause by agreement, contingent on the success of their stay motion.

Beyond the immediate legal challenge to overturn Justice Zinn's ruling, UOF's public position, articulated by Pasitney, frames their fight in much broader terms. "This is all about the rights of Canadians protecting our farmers," she stated, emphasizing a direct challenge to the CFIA's "stamping out policy," which she described as "an outdated policy that needs revamping and it needs to be readjusted to protect our farmers and to protect our Canadians."

UOF is advocating for a more collaborative and science-driven approach. Pasitney highlighted the CFIA's previous statements about being "always open to new science" and extended an invitation: "We're really inviting them to let us help them, let us help you." This call for cooperation is underscored by the farm's belief in the unique immunological characteristics of their flock, a belief now bolstered by the significant international interest from the HHS. Pasitney expressed hope that the HHS letter "would open a door for us to work with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency," allowing for study rather than destruction.

The farm is also pushing for systemic changes, seeking "more accountability" from the CFIA, a "revamp" of policies they deem ineffective, and critically, "the right to test or treat your own animals," which Pasitney argues "should be a human right."

The Regional District of Central Kootenay's (RDCK) vote on May 15, 2025, to refuse the ostrich carcasses at its landfills until the CFIA re-tests the currently healthy birds and publicizes the results, adds another layer of complexity for the CFIA should the cull proceed.

**A Broader Impact:**

The Universal Ostrich Farms case has evolved from a localized animal health crisis into a multifaceted battle with far-reaching implications. The appeal is not merely a legalistic challenge to a court ruling but a public call, spearheaded by the farm, for a paradigm shift in how animal health crises are managed, particularly when unique scientific opportunities, long-standing agricultural practices, and fundamental farmers' rights are at stake. The CFIA faces the dual pressures of upholding its existing mandate and policies while contending with compelling international scientific interest and a passionate, publicly-articulated demand for policy reform and collaboration from the affected farmers. The outcome will be closely watched by scientific communities, agricultural bodies, and animal welfare advocates globally.

The fight to save the Universal Ostrich Farms (UOF) flock is deeply intertwined with the argument that these birds are far more than just agricultural commodities; they are, in many ways, more akin to cherished, long-term research animals or even pets, with a profound human connection. This perspective starkly contrasts with the commercial poultry industry model, for which the CFIA's "Stamping-Out Policy" was primarily formulated.

**More Than Livestock: The Human Connection and "Pet-Like" Status**

For the Espersen and Bilinski families, the ostriches are not an anonymous, short-lived agricultural product. They represent over three decades of dedication, a life's work, and an intimate part of their family and farm identity.

1.  **Longevity and Individual Relationships:** Ostriches are long-lived animals, capable of living 50 years or more. Many birds at UOF have been with the family for decades (Decision, para [13], [25]). This extended timeframe naturally fosters deeper bonds than those formed in the rapid lifecycle of commercial poultry. Katie Pasitney, the farm's spokesperson and daughter of co-owner Karen Espersen, grew up with many of these ostriches. As highlighted on the "SaveOurOstriches.com" website, individual birds like "Frank" (the farm's "beloved mascot"), "Precious," "Kari," and others are known by name and have distinct personalities recognized by the family. This individual recognition and long-term care is characteristic of how people relate to pets or highly valued individual animals, not typically to a depersonalized commercial "flock."

2.  **Emotional Impact and Daily Interaction:** The emotional distress evident in the family's public statements and videos underscores this deep connection. Karen Espersen’s tearful plea, as described in news reports quoting her Facebook video, "We’ve taken years to be able to pet these guys, walk among these guys. We love these guys. They’re all happy and healthy," speaks volumes about the human-animal bond. This level of daily, hands-on interaction and affection is far removed from the management practices of a large-scale, automated poultry operation.

3.  **Shift to Research, Not Consumption:** Around 2020, UOF shifted its primary focus from meat production to breeding stock and, significantly, antibody research (Decision, para [13], [26]). This further distinguishes them from typical "poultry" destined for the food chain. Their value, in the farm's view, lies in their unique genetics cultivated over 30 years (SaveOurOstriches.com, Official Statement) and their potential contributions to science, particularly through IgY antibodies from their eggs. This aligns them more closely with specialized research animal colonies than with commercial food production units.

**A World Apart: Ostriches vs. The Commercial Poultry Industry Model**

The CFIA's "Stamping-Out Policy," as acknowledged by the agency itself (Decision, para [233]), was primarily developed based on experiences with commercial chickens and turkeys. Applying this policy rigidly to UOF's ostriches, the farm argues, is a misapplication due to fundamental differences:

1.  **Physiology and Lifespan:** Ostriches are physiologically distinct from chickens and turkeys. Their significantly longer lifespans mean that culling a flock represents the loss of decades of genetic development and individual animal history, unlike the few weeks or months for broilers or 1-2 years for commercial laying hens.

2.  **Farming Systems and Density:** UOF operates on a 65-acre property with approximately 400 ostriches (Decision, para [13], [24]). This is a vastly different environment from the high-density confinement systems typical of commercial poultry operations, where diseases can spread with extreme rapidity among tens or hundreds of thousands of birds housed closely together. The rationale for immediate, widespread culling in such dense poultry systems is driven by the high risk of rapid, uncontrollable transmission.

3.  **Disease Dynamics and Observed Resilience:** UOF has consistently highlighted that only about 15% of their flock succumbed to the illness over a month (Official Statement, SaveOurOstriches.com), with the last death on January 15, 2025, and the remainder appearing healthy since. This observed lower mortality and apparent recovery period contrasts sharply with the devastating, swift mortality (often >90%) typically seen in HPAI outbreaks in commercial chicken or turkey flocks. This difference, UOF argues, suggests a different disease dynamic in their ostriches with this specific viral strain, potentially warranting a different response than a blanket "stamping out."

4.  **Economic and Genetic Value:** The economic model of UOF is not based on mass production of low-cost meat or eggs for consumption. Their value proposition centers on "rare and valuable poultry genetics" (as they initially tried to argue under CFIA's exemption) cultivated over decades for breeding and, crucially, their "acquired scientific rarity" due to their unique H5N1 exposure and potential immunity (Legal Arguments document; HHS Letter). This specialized, research-oriented value is vastly different from the commodity value of a commercial chicken. Even CFIA's compensation regulations acknowledge a higher individual value for ostriches (up to $3,000) compared to standard poultry (Decision, para [85]).

5.  **Purpose of the Policy:** The "Stamping-Out Policy" is designed to quickly eradicate a disease threat to protect a massive, economically vital, and highly interconnected commercial poultry industry from catastrophic losses and trade disruptions. UOF argues that their isolated, research-focused, non-commercial (in the traditional sense) ostrich farm does not pose the same type or scale of risk that the policy was designed to mitigate. Culling their flock, they contend, sacrifices unique scientific potential without a proportionate benefit to the broader poultry industry.

In essence, Universal Ostrich Farms argues that the CFIA is attempting to fit a square peg into a round hole. The ostriches at UOF are not anonymous units in a rapid-turnover food production system; they are long-lived, individually recognized animals with whom the family has a deep, multi-generational bond, and which now hold significant, internationally recognized scientific potential. The very nature of their operation, their animals, and the specific circumstances of the outbreak, they contend, demand a more nuanced and scientifically adaptive approach than the blunt instrument of a policy designed for an entirely different sector of agriculture.

## File: articles/uof_damages-2025-05-27.md

The legal battle and the looming threat of a cull order from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) have inflicted substantial and multifaceted economic damages on Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (UOF). These damages extend far beyond the mere market value of standard livestock, touching every aspect of their specialized, research-oriented operation.

1.  **Direct Loss of Irreplaceable, High-Value Assets (The Flock Itself):**
    *   **Beyond Standard Compensation:** While the CFIA's regulations offer compensation up to $3,000 per ostrich (Decision, para [85]), UOF argues this vastly undervalues their flock. Their ostriches are not standard commercial birds. As stated on their website (SaveOurOstriches.com, Official Statement), the farm places a significantly higher value on their animals, with breeding roosters estimated at $7,500 CDN and antibody-producing hens at a remarkable $93,000 CDN each. The loss of nearly 400 such specialized animals represents a catastrophic direct asset loss.
    *   **Decades of Genetic Investment:** The farm has engaged in "decades of selective breeding work" (Decision, para [1], [25]). This represents an immense investment of time, expertise, and resources to cultivate unique genetic lines. Culling the flock would obliterate this irreplaceable genetic heritage, a loss far exceeding any standard compensation.
    *   **Loss of Research Potential:** The primary economic value of the flock, particularly since 2020, has shifted to their potential in antibody research (Decision, para [13], [26]). The recent letter from the U.S. HHS Secretary, NIH Director, and FDA Commissioner (legal/rfk_letter.md) powerfully underscores this, highlighting the "significant value in studying this population." The destruction of these birds would mean the loss of unique biological material essential for ongoing and future research projects, including potential collaborations with international bodies, which carry significant economic and scientific value.

2.  **Loss of Current and Future Income Streams:**
    *   **Antibody (IgY) Research and Commercialization:** UOF's focus on extracting immunoglobulin Y from ostrich eggs for human-virus diagnostics and therapeutics (Decision, para [13], [26]) represents a key future income stream. The CFIA's actions and the ongoing uncertainty have crippled their ability to pursue contracts, collaborations (like with Kyoto University, Decision, para [38]), and the development of proprietary products in this niche market.
    *   **Breeding Stock Sales:** For years, UOF diversified by selling breeding stock (Decision, para [13]). The cull order and quarantine effectively halt this revenue stream, as they cannot sell or move animals.
    *   **Agri-Tourism and Other Products:** The farm also offered agri-tourism tours and processed limited amounts of meat and other ostrich-derived products (Decision, para [13], [26]). The quarantine, negative publicity, and the fight to save the flock have inevitably disrupted these ancillary income sources.

3.  **Crippling Legal and Administrative Costs:**
    *   **Legal Fees:** UOF has incurred substantial legal fees fighting the CFIA's orders. The "SaveOurOstriches.com" donate page states they are "over a hundred thousand dollars in debt legally, still."
    *   **CFIA's Legal Costs:** Adding insult to injury, Justice Zinn's decision ordered UOF to pay $15,000 towards the CFIA's legal costs (Decision, para [271]).
    *   **Potential Fines:** The farm's Official Statement mentions "two unjustified $10,000 fines" issued by the CFIA, which threaten to further erode any potential compensation and add to their financial burden.

4.  **Operational Disruptions and Costs:**
    *   **Quarantine Restrictions:** The imposition of quarantine since December 2024 (Decision, para [30], [31]) has severely restricted normal farm operations, affecting routine care, breeding programs, and any commercial activities.
    *   **Diversion of Resources:** The enormous amount of time, energy, and emotional labor invested by the farm owners and their family (notably Katie Pasitney) into fighting the cull order represents a significant diversion of resources from farm development, research, and income-generating activities.
    *   **Inability to Plan or Invest:** The constant uncertainty makes long-term planning, investment in infrastructure, or securing new research partnerships virtually impossible.

5.  **Damage to Business Reputation and Future Prospects:**
    *   While difficult to quantify, the public nature of this dispute and the "infected" status (even if disputed or historic) can damage the farm's reputation, making it harder to attract future research collaborations, investors, or customers for their specialized products, should they manage to save the flock.
    *   The loss of momentum in their pioneering antibody research could allow competitors to gain an advantage in a nascent field.

In summary, the economic damages to Universal Ostrich Farms are profound and existential. They face not only the direct loss of a highly specialized and, in their view, vastly undervalued flock but also the collapse of their current and future business model, which is heavily invested in scientific research and unique genetics. Compounded by crippling legal fees and potential fines, the CFIA's actions have pushed this decades-old family farm to the brink of financial ruin, jeopardizing their livelihoods and a potentially significant contribution to scientific advancement.

## File: legal/appeal_arguments.md

Based on the provided Federal Court decision (2025 FC 878, Justice Zinn) and the supporting documents (`legal_arguments.md`, `dataset_website-content-crawler_*.jsonl`), here's a formulation of strong legal arguments for an appeal, aimed at overturning Justice Zinn's decision.

**Core Principle for Appeal:** An appeal must argue that Justice Zinn made an error of law, a palpable and overriding error of fact, or that his application of the reasonableness standard was itself unreasonable. It is not a re-hearing of the original case.

**Key Arguments for Appeal:**

1.  **Error in Law Regarding Procedural Fairness: Failure to Consider Material Evidence Commissioned by the CFIA Prior to Decision (Dr. French's Literature Review).**
    *   **Argument:** Justice Zinn erred in law by finding the CFIA's Exemption Denial was procedurally fair and reasonable despite the Exemption Committee not waiting for Dr. Shannon French's rapid literature review on avian influenza in ostriches, which it had itself commissioned on the morning of the decision (paras 56, 233). The judge reasoned this omission was not a "fatal flaw" because the report, when later submitted, would not have altered the outcome (para 239, 241).
    *   **Basis for Appeal:**
        *   **Procedural Fairness:** A decision-maker commissioning a report it deems important enough to inform its decision, then rendering that decision *before* receiving and considering the report, is a breach of its duty to consider relevant information and a flaw in the deliberative process itself. The *potential* content of the report (as assessed in hindsight by the judge) does not cure this fundamental procedural defect. Fairness demands consideration of information the decision-maker itself sought for the decision.
        *   **Reasonableness of Process:** Justice Zinn may have erred in focusing on the *outcome* (report wouldn't change decision) rather than the *process*. A reasonable decision-making process, especially where stakes are high, requires due diligence. Issuing a decision hours before receiving solicited expert input, acknowledged by the Agency as important due to policy primarily being based on chickens/turkeys (para 233), is arguably unreasonable on its face. The judge's conclusion that the Committee "appropriately grappled with relevant and material evidence" (para 242) is questionable if they preempted evidence they sought.
        *   *Precedent/Principle:* The duty of fairness requires an opportunity to be heard on all significant evidence considered by the decision-maker. If the report was commissioned to inform the decision, its absence at the moment of decision makes the record incomplete.

2.  **Error in Applying the Reasonableness Standard to CFIA's Application of the "Stamping-Out" Policy and Exemption Criteria to a Unique Research Ostrich Flock.**
    *   **Argument:** Justice Zinn erred in finding the CFIA's application of its 2022 ERP (Stamping-Out Policy and exemption criteria) to this specific, unique research-focused ostrich flock was reasonable. The CFIA failed to adequately justify applying a policy primarily designed for commercial poultry (para 233) to these distinct animals without a more nuanced, species-specific risk assessment and consideration of their unique scientific value (as argued by the Applicant, paras 26, 49, 52, 235).
    *   **Basis for Appeal:**
        *   **Demonstrated Expertise (Vavilov para 93):** While deference is owed, Justice Zinn may have erred if the CFIA did not *demonstrate* sufficient expertise specific to H5N1 in ostriches and the unique research context *at the time of the decisions*. The Applicant's provided courtroom notes (from `legal_arguments.md` based on the hearing transcript) suggest CFIA experts admitted limitations in their knowledge regarding ostrich-specific transmission or the novel viral strain (courtroom notes from April 15, Updates #1, #2, #4). If this was on the record before Justice Zinn, he may have given undue deference.
        *   **Ignoring Relevant Factors (Vavilov para 126):** The CFIA's focus on broad trade implications (paras 56, 100, 255) may have been found reasonable by Justice Zinn, but he may have erred if he didn't find the CFIA's engagement with the *specific evidence of the ostriches' acquired immunity, their unique genetic value for ongoing antibody research, and their distinct epidemiological context (non-commercial, isolated)* (paras 26, 28, 42, 52) was inadequate. The judge acknowledged the Committee rejected "selective culling" after multidisciplinary consultation (para 254), but the depth and reasonableness of *that specific rejection for this unique flock* could be challenged.
        *   **"Rare and Valuable Genetics" Exemption:** The judge upheld CFIA's finding that the Applicant didn't provide sufficient proof (paras 56, 251). However, the argument could be made that the CFIA (and subsequently the judge) unreasonably narrowed the interpretation of "rare and valuable" to traditional breed registry standards, failing to consider the *acquired scientific rarity and value* of a flock potentially immune to a novel H5N1 strain and central to ongoing international antibody research (as per website/user's argument). The email from the Case Officer stating "you fall into the 'birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics' category" (para 51) could be argued to have set a different initial understanding that was unreasonably narrowed.
        *   **Proportionality (Vavilov para 133-135):** Given the ostriches' reported health since mid-January 2025 (para 42, website info) and their significant scientific value (paras 13, 26), the decision to cull the entire flock, as upheld by Justice Zinn, might be argued as disproportionate to the *actual, demonstrated risk posed by these specific animals at the time of the Exemption Denial*. Did the CFIA adequately weigh this unique loss against the generalized risk? Justice Zinn found the CFIA's reasons reflected the impact (paras 261-266), but an appeal could argue this reflection was insufficient given the unique circumstances.

3.  **Error in Law/Fact Regarding the "Poultry" Classification and Viral Pathogenicity for the Trigger of the Stamping-Out Policy in this Specific Case.**
    *   **Argument:** Justice Zinn found the CFIA's 2022 ERP was the operative document and its H5 RRT-PCR positive result triggered the policy for a non-index case (paras 101, 175-178). However, he may have erred in not finding it unreasonable for the CFIA to:
        *   (a) Apply a broad "poultry" definition from its ERP (para 102) to a specialized ostrich research flock without more specific justification, particularly when WOAH definitions (which the CFIA claims to align with, para 93) might offer more nuance for ostriches.
        *   (b) Rely on a simplified trigger (H5 RRT-PCR) for a *novel H5N1 genotype* (paras 32, 128, courtroom notes April 15, Update #4) in ostriches without conducting or awaiting full pathotyping or a more detailed risk assessment *specific to this new variant in this atypical avian species*.
    *   **Basis for Appeal:** This argument contends that the *application* of the ERP's triggers and definitions was unreasonable in these highly unique circumstances, demanding a more cautious and investigative approach from the CFIA before resorting to the Stamping-Out Policy. The CFIA's own acknowledgment of a "unique reassortment of genome type not identified before in Canada" (courtroom notes April 15, Update #4) should have heightened the need for specific assessment, not a default application of a general policy.

4.  **Error in Upholding Procedural Fairness: Misleading Communications and Failure to Provide Full Disclosure Regarding Exemption Process.**
    *   **Argument:** Justice Zinn erred in finding the CFIA met its procedural fairness obligations during the exemption process. The CFIA's communications were misleading, and it failed to disclose the full "Exemptions from depopulation appendix" (para 229), prejudicing the Applicant's ability to fully know and meet the case.
    *   **Basis for Appeal:**
        *   **Legitimate Expectation (Procedural):** While the judge found no *unqualified* promise (paras 217-224), the cumulative effect of the Case Officer's email stating the farm "fall[s] into the 'birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics' category" (para 51) and subsequent interactions could be argued to have created a legitimate expectation for a specific, more flexible procedural approach tailored to "rare genetics" that was then unfairly changed or narrowly applied.
        *   **Knowing the Case:** The judge found all *material* content from the appendix was conveyed (para 229). However, an appeal could argue that without the *full context* of the appendix, particularly any nuances or examples not explicitly transcribed in emails, the Applicant was indeed hampered. The later imposition of what the Applicant *perceived* as a "significant burden of proof" (even if the judge found it was just a restatement) felt like a shift in goalposts because the full policy underpinnings were not transparently provided from the outset.

**Strategic Considerations for the Appeal:**

*   **Focus on Errors of Law by Justice Zinn:** The appeal is not a chance to re-argue the facts as if it were a new judicial review, but to show where Justice Zinn's legal reasoning or his application of the reasonableness standard was flawed.
*   **The "Record Before the Decision-Maker":** While the current health of the ostriches (months of no illness) is powerful, it was *not* before the CFIA for the Dec 31/Jan 10 decisions. The appeal must focus on the unreasonableness of CFIA's decisions *based on what they knew or should have reasonably ascertained then*.
    *   **However, this ongoing health and the RDCK's subsequent stance (refusing carcasses until re-testing, as per website news) could be used to frame the *importance and gravity* of the appeal, and to argue for a more flexible, adaptive approach from CFIA should the matter be remitted.**
*   **Highlighting the Unique Nature of the Flock:** Continuously emphasize that this is not a standard commercial poultry operation but a long-standing research flock with demonstrated potential for antibody development (paras 13, 26, website information). This context is crucial for arguing that a blanket application of general policies was unreasonable.
*   **Expert Evidence:** The appeal will scrutinize how Justice Zinn handled the expert evidence that *was* on the record. If CFIA experts indeed showed limited ostrich-specific knowledge *on the original record*, this undermines the deference Justice Zinn afforded.

Winning this appeal will be challenging given the deference afforded to the CFIA on technical matters and the judge's thorough reasons. The strongest arguments will likely revolve around:
1.  The procedural unreasonableness of the Exemption Committee not waiting for its own commissioned report.
2.  The substantive unreasonableness of the CFIA applying its general policies inflexibly to such a unique research flock without a more tailored assessment, especially concerning the "rare and valuable genetics" criteria and the novel viral strain.
3.  Arguing that Justice Zinn erred in law by not finding these CFIA actions unreasonable or procedurally unfair.

This approach focuses on the specific application of policy to unique facts, which is a recognized ground for reasonableness review, rather than a frontal assault on the Stamping-Out Policy itself, which Justice Zinn found reasonable.

The CFIA's communications were misleading, and it failed to disclose the full "Exemptions from depopulation appendix" (para 229), prejudicing the Applicant's ability to fully know and meet the case.
    *   **Basis for Appeal:**
        *   **Legitimate Expectation (Procedural):** While the judge found no *unqualified* promise (paras 217-224), the cumulative effect of the Case Officer's email stating the farm "fall[s] into the 'birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics' category" (para 51) and subsequent interactions could be argued to have created a legitimate expectation for a specific, more flexible procedural approach tailored to "rare genetics" that was then unfairly changed or narrowly applied.
        *   **Knowing the Case:** The judge found all *material* content from the appendix was conveyed (para 229). However, an appeal could argue that without the *full context* of the appendix, particularly any nuances or examples not explicitly transcribed in emails, the Applicant was indeed hampered. The later imposition of what the Applicant *perceived* as a "significant burden of proof" (even if the judge found it was just a restatement) felt like a shift in goalposts because the full policy underpinnings were not transparently provided from the outset.

**Strategic Considerations for the Appeal:**

*   **Focus on Errors of Law by Justice Zinn:** The appeal is not a chance to re-argue the facts as if it were a new judicial review, but to show where Justice Zinn's legal reasoning or his application of the reasonableness standard was flawed.
*   **The "Record Before the Decision-Maker":** While the current health of the ostriches (months of no illness) is powerful, it was *not* before the CFIA for the Dec 31/Jan 10 decisions. The appeal must focus on the unreasonableness of CFIA's decisions *based on what they knew or should have reasonably ascertained then*.
    *   **However, this ongoing health and the RDCK's subsequent stance (refusing carcasses until re-testing, as per website news) could be used to frame the *importance and gravity* of the appeal, and to argue for a more flexible, adaptive approach from CFIA should the matter be remitted.**
*   **Highlighting the Unique Nature of the Flock:** Continuously emphasize that this is not a standard commercial poultry operation but a long-standing research flock with demonstrated potential for antibody development (paras 13, 26, website information). This context is crucial for arguing that a blanket application of general policies was unreasonable.
*   **Expert Evidence:** The appeal will scrutinize how Justice Zinn handled the expert evidence that *was* on the record. If CFIA experts indeed showed limited ostrich-specific knowledge *on the original record*, this undermines the deference Justice Zinn afforded.

Winning this appeal will be challenging given the deference afforded to the CFIA on technical matters and the judge's thorough reasons. The strongest arguments will likely revolve around:
1.  The procedural unreasonableness of the Exemption Committee not waiting for its own commissioned report.
2.  The substantive unreasonableness of the CFIA applying its general policies inflexibly to such a unique research flock without a more tailored assessment, especially concerning the "rare and valuable genetics" criteria and the novel viral strain.
3.  Arguing that Justice Zinn erred in law by not finding these CFIA actions unreasonable or procedurally unfair.

This approach focuses on the specific application of policy to unique facts, which is a recognized ground for reasonableness review, rather than a frontal assault on the Stamping-Out Policy itself, which Justice Zinn found reasonable.

# I. Overview

[1] The Applicant, Universal Ostrich Farms Inc., challenges two related decisions made by the Respondent, Canadian Food Inspection Agency [the CFIA or the Agency], under section 48 of the Health of Animals Act, SC 1990, c 21 [the Act]. The first decision, a Notice to Dispose issued on December 31, 2024, ordered the destruction of all ostriches on the farm after laboratory tests confirmed infection with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI]. The second, an Exemption Denial, dated January 10, 2025, refused the farm's request to spare the flock on the basis that the ostriches formed a self-contained, unexposed "distinct epidemiological unit" with "rare and valuable poultry genetics," thus qualifying for an exemption from the Notice to Dispose under the CFIA's Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 2022 Event Response Plan [the 2022 ERP].

[2] At the heart of this proceeding lies an inevitable tension between the CFIA's mandate to protect public health and the Applicant's wish to preserve its ostriches. Parliament has charged the CFIA with preventing the spread of designated zoonotic and enzootic diseases and with protecting the food supply, public health, and Canada's reputation in global trade. To do so, the Agency complies with the internationally recognized and applied "Stamping-Out Policy" approach recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health [WOAH] that requires rapid culling of affected avian populations. Conversely, the Applicant faces the loss of decades of selective breeding work, disruption to valuable commercial and scientific research, and destruction of birds that might no longer pose an active, ongoing risk of transmitting HPAI. Against this backdrop, the Applicant contends that the CFIA has, in issuing the Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial, disregarded its unique circumstances and fallen short of providing basic procedural fairness.

[3] These two applications address whether the CFIA's decisions were reasonable and procedurally fair based on facts available to the Agency at the time. This is not an appeal. The Court is not stepping into the shoes of the Agency and making the decisions that the Court feels ought to have been made. Instead, the focus of the review is on the Agency's reasoning and process.

[4] I dismiss both applications for judicial review. The Agency's decisions were reasonable based on the record before the decision-maker and were made in a procedurally fair manner.

[5] Courts must respect Parliament's choice to assign decision-making power to administrative bodies. This respect comes from the principle of separation of powers, a cornerstone of Canadian public law: Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, 2015 FCA 17 at para 30. The separation of powers compels courts to respect the legislature's choice to assign decision-making power to specialized administrative bodies, such as the CFIA, rather than to the judiciary: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] at para 30.

[6] Courts must also respect the demonstrated scientific and technical expertise of administrative agencies. In administrative law, courts generally stay out of scientific debates and focus on whether the decision-makers used their expertise to make reasonable and procedurally fair decisions. When Parliament leaves technical or scientific assessments to specialized administrative bodies, it signals that those bodies, not the courts, are best positioned to make judgments on complex, expertise-driven matters. Indeed, Canadian administrative law explicitly warns that courts must not resolve scientific disputes or substitute their own views for those of specialized decision-makers authorized by Parliament to handle such issues: Vavilov at para 93. Judges are experts in law, not in public health, virology, epidemiology, or veterinary medicine. This case undeniably has a strong technical flavour. Both parties have submitted expert affidavits supported by scientific literature. The role of this Court is not to conduct afresh its own studies of that material and decide which science is correct, but to determine whether the CFIA's decisions were reasonable and procedurally fair based on the record before it.

[7] Judicial review hinges on what was before the decision-maker. With very few exceptions, reviewing courts on judicial review must mentally travel back to the moment when the decision was made, and judge the decision with only the evidence that was before the decision-maker at that moment. Here, the dates are December 31, 2024 for the Notice to Dispose and January 10, 2025 for the Exemption Denial. A reviewing court must assess administrative decisions based exclusively on the information available to the decision-makers at the time they made those decisions: Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 FCA 22 at para 19; Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v Alberta Teachers' Association, 2011 SCC 61 at paras 22-26.

[8] If courts conducted judicial review with information that did not exist at the time of decision-making, they would be faulting decision-makers for lacking a crystal ball. No one has the gift of foresight, so courts must avoid reviewing decisions through the lens of hindsight. Therefore, this Court cannot consider "new" evidence, such as the current health status of the ostriches, recent test results, or updated scientific developments that become available only after January 10, 2025, the date of the Agency's last decision.

[9] Concepts like "reasonableness" and "procedural fairness" have specific meanings in administrative law, defined and refined over years of jurisprudence. Reasonableness asks whether the CFIA's explanation of its decisions tells a compelling story of how it reached them. Whether the story is compelling enough depends on whether the outcome and reasons are logically supported by the evidence on record, consistent with applicable law, and aligned with the Agency's past practices and own policies. Reasonableness does not ask whether the outcome is the best or most persuasive course of action.

[10] Procedural fairness is about the decision-making process itself, not the outcome. This assessment asks questions such as whether the Applicant received timely notice, whether the Applicant had meaningful chance to be heard, and whether the CFIA followed the procedures that it promised it would. In this context, fairness is not about whether the substantive outcome feels fair in an everyday understanding, but whether the CFIA adhered to the required legal standards of fairness in the process it followed to reach its decisions. Keeping these legal meanings in mind helps avoid the understandable, but legally misplaced, reaction of equating "harsh outcome" with "unfair decision."

[11] This Court accepts that there is a real and negative impact of the CFIA's two decisions on the Applicant and its principals. Beyond the economic loss, the destruction of a long-established ostrich population is also a source of emotional distress, particularly given the decades of work and investment the principals have dedicated to breeding and raising their flock. I have considerable sympathy for them.

[12] Nonetheless, such personal losses must be weighed against the broader public interest in protecting public health and maintaining trade stability. Avian influenza is a virus capable of causing serious harm to both animals and humans, with significant implications for Canada's poultry businesses and international trade status. To combat threats like this virus, Parliament has authorized the CFIA to act decisively making swift decisions with far-reaching consequences, often under conditions of scientific uncertainty. This is a challenging mandate.

# II. Background

## A. The parties

[13] The Applicant operates a privately owned ostrich farm and research business located approximately ten kilometres outside Edgewood, British Columbia. The 65-acre operation is primarily managed by two principals with ostrich husbandry and selective breeding experience dating back to the mid-1990s. Over the years, the Applicant has diversified its business portfolio to encompass operations in selling breeding stock, raising birds for slaughter, processing limited amounts of meat, offering agri-tourism tours, and, in recent years, focusing on extracting immunoglobulin Y from ostrich eggs for use in human-virus diagnostics.

[14] The CFIA has the statutory authority granted by the Act and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, SC 1997, c 6. While commonly associated with the regulation of food safety and quality in Canada, the Agency's broader mandate includes preventing and controlling communicable diseases in animals and plants that threaten public health, environmental integrity, or Canada's economic interests, including international trade in livestock and animal products. In furtherance of this mandate, the CFIA administers the 2022 ERP, which is the latest formalization and operationalization of the Stamping-Out Policy. The Agency reports to the Minister of Health, except where the Act assigns powers, duties, or functions to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for matters unrelated to food safety.

## B. The avian influenza virus

[15] Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is caused by influenza A viruses. Like all viruses, avian influenza viruses cannot replicate on their own and must infect hosts to do so. Their usual hosts are wild birds. Migratory waterfowl, particularly wild ducks, serve as natural hosts, potentially returning from their overwintering grounds each year with new viral variants. These viruses can also occasionally spread to domestic birds and, more rarely and sporadically, to mammals like humans.

[16] For domestic birds, transmission of the virus can occur through direct contact with infected wild or domestic birds, as well as through indirect exposure to contaminated environments. The ability of avian influenza to persist in the environment contributes to its transmission. It can persist outside of hosts in feces, grass, and soil. It can remain viable for months or even years in fresh water at low temperatures, creating long-lasting sources of infection or re-infection. On small holding operations like the Applicant's ostrich farm, common risk factors for transmission include direct contact between domestic and wild birds, proximity to environments such as wetlands, ponds, swamps, lakes, rivers, and grain fields, and the acquisition of birds with unknown health status.

[17] Human infection with avian influenza is rare but potentially deadly. Infection typically occurs through close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments, particularly where appropriate personal protective equipment and hygiene measures are lacking. Some strains of the virus are particularly lethal. For instance, approximately half of the more than 900 reported cases of human H5N1 infection worldwide since 1997 have resulted in death.

[18] Each strain of the avian influenza is identified by two special proteins on its surface: hemagglutinin, designated "H," and neuraminidase, designated "N." Hemagglutinin helps the virus bind to and enter host cells, while neuraminidase enables release and propagation of the virus from the host cells. The combination of H and N proteins plays a large role in deciding which specific animals the virus can infect, how easily it spreads, and how the host immune system recognizes and reacts to it. To date, sixteen hemagglutinin subtypes, H1-H16, and nine neuraminidase subtypes, N1-N9, have been documented in birds, producing the familiar binomial viral strain names such as "H5N1" or "H7N9."

[19] However, knowing the H and N subtypes of an avian influenza strain alone does not sufficiently reveal how harmful it is for birds. The avian influenza ability to cause serious disease, or its "pathogenicity," strongly depends on a small section of the hemagglutinin protein called the "cleavage site." At this site, certain host enzymes must cut the hemagglutinin to activate the virus. Depending on the sequence of amino acids at the cleavage site, the virus may either spread systematically throughout the host's body and damage multiple organs, or stay limited to the lungs, kidneys, or gastrointestinal tract and cause less serious consequences. In other words, the level of pathogenicity of avian influenza in birds depends heavily on the molecular structure of its cleavage site, as revealed by the amino acid sequence there.

[20] To find out the pathogenicity of a particular strain of avian influenza, one performs pathotyping. This usually involves testing three things: the subtype of hemagglutinin, the subtype of neuraminidase, and the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site. To do this, the laboratory technique called real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RRTPCR] is used to detect the genes for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase and identify their subtypes, such as "H5" and "N1." To analyze the cleavage site, the part of the hemagglutinin gene containing the cleavage site is amplified and then sequenced to see whether it has the amino acid pattern linked to high or low pathogenicity avian influenza [LPAI].

## C. Avian influenza outbreaks in Canada

[21] Canada first confronted a major HPAI outbreak in 2004 in British Columbia. In February of that year, an LPAI H7N3 virus was detected in the Fraser Valley region. By March, the virus had mutated into an HPAI, spreading rapidly across both commercial and non-commercial premises. To contain the virus, over 14 million birds were disposed of. Two human cases were reported, both presenting with conjunctivitis and mild influenza-like symptoms. Both individuals recovered fully. The outbreak was declared over by June 2004.

[22] Several smaller HPAI events occurred between 2004 and the current outbreak. The most significant occurred in 2015, when North America faced widespread outbreaks of H5N2 and H5N8 HPAI strains. In Canada, the impact was concentrated primarily in commercial poultry flocks in Ontario.

[23] The current nationwide HPAI outbreak began in November 2021 and has affected every province except Prince Edward Island. The outbreak started with detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in wild bird populations in Canada before spreading to domestic poultry. Since then, HPAI has been confirmed on 527 domestic premises across the country, with British Columbia reporting the highest number of cases and some premises experiencing repeated infections. The outbreak has affected operations ranging from small backyard flocks to large scale commercial farms. Canada also recorded its first domestically acquired human case in late 2024, when a British Columbia teenager became critically ill and required intensive care. The individual has since made a full recovery.

# III. Facts

## A. The Applicant's ostrich operation

[24] The Applicant's property features open-air enclosures with shared facilities and proximity to wildlife. The farm is arranged with fenced and cross-fenced areas intended to separate groups of ostriches for breeding and care, while also providing a degree of biosecurity. No roofed barns segregate ostriches of different age groups. A large natural pond, routinely visited by wild ducks and other waterfowl, lies near the centre, in between two of the outdoor bird pens.

[25] The Applicant has developed what it considers a uniquely large strain of ostriches through selective breeding since the 1990s. The ostriches are allegedly selected for body size and favourable genetic traits, with surplus birds not meeting these standards being discarded or culled. Some ostriches currently on the farm trace back to early imports from Africa and remain part of the breeding stock.

[26] From approximately 2020 onward, the Applicant shifted its primary commercial focus to extracting and studying antibodies, notably immunoglobulin Y, from ostrich eggs. For the Applicant, these antibodies have lucrative commercial and research values, especially in the development of diagnostics or therapeutics relevant to human viruses, such as the COVID-19 causing virus of SARS-CoV-2. To advance this antibody-based venture, the Applicant has collaborated with both domestic and international partners, including scientific researchers and private sector entities. Despite this strategic shift, some level of ostrich sales, along with sales or planned sales of products derived from ostrich fat and eggshells, continued through to at least December 2024.

[27] By early December 2024, the farm reportedly housed about 450 ostriches, including older breeding stock and newly introduced birds.

## B. Infections, investigations, and CFIA interventions

[28] In February 2020, the Applicant's ostriches experienced a significant illness, reportedly resulting in roughly ten deaths. Laboratory tests confirmed bacterial infections caused by Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Although unsupported by laboratory findings, the farm's principals speculated in hindsight that avian influenza might have contributed to the illness. Most ostriches were said to have recovered within weeks, leading the principals to suspect survivors might have developed natural immunity to future outbreaks of HPAI.

[29] In early December 2024, a new outbreak of respiratory symptoms emerged shortly after wild duck exposure. The Applicant observed respiratory or "flu-like" symptoms among a subset of ostriches, reminiscent of the 2020 illness. According to the farm's principals, those symptoms appeared roughly one week after "300-500 ducks ... landed on the premises." By late December, mortalities began increasing, particularly among newer ostriches, prompting consultation with a local veterinarian. Approximately 25 to 30 ostriches died within a three-week period.

[30] The CFIA intervened on December 28, 2024, following an anonymous report of multiple ostrich deaths at the Applicant's premises. The Agency promptly contacted the Applicant and imposed a verbal quarantine order on the premises, with formal documentation to follow. The next day, the Applicant requested that a CFIA veterinarian assess the flock for avian influenza. Four additional ostriches died that same day.

[31] On December 30, 2024, CFIA inspectors visited the premises, collected swab samples from two carcasses suitable for laboratory testing, noted wild-bird activity at the pond, and observed that staff and equipment were shared and moved freely among open pens. That same day, the CFIA sent the Applicant a Declaration of Infected Place pursuant to section 22 of the Act and a Requirement to Quarantine per section 91.4 of the Health of Animals Regulations, CRC, c 296. These orders imposed movement controls and established biosecurity measures aimed at containing the HPAI outbreak on the Applicant's premises by preventing access to infected birds, carcasses, and contaminated areas by wild birds, other animals, and people.

[32] On December 31, 2024, the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network laboratory in Abbotsford, British Columbia, reported positive test results for the H5 avian influenza subtype. On January 3, 2025, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg, Manitoba, confirmed through genome sequencing that the pathogen was a HPAI subtype, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, and noted the virus's cleavage-site motif with amino acids "PLREKRRKR/GLF" was "compatible with HPAI viruses that came to Canada via the Pacific's flyway."

[33] The CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose on December 31, 2024, immediately after receiving confirmation of a positive test result for H5 avian influenza. Just 41 minutes after obtaining the test result, the CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose as guided by the 2022 ERP and pursuant to subsection 48(3) of the Act. The CFIA set February 1, 2025, as the deadline for disposal of all affected birds and related materials.

[34] On January 2, 2025, the CFIA Case Officer assigned to the Applicant's case contacted its principals to introduce herself, provide an overview of the situation, and establish a line of communication to guide them through the multi-step administrative process. Their first interaction was a phone call, during which the principals first raised their theory that the older ostriches may have developed herd immunity because of the unreported 2020 "flu-like" illness, and expressed interest in seeking an exemption from depopulation. The Case Officer explained the exemption application process, emphasized its time-sensitive and document-intensive nature, and highlighted the need to submit a formal "Distinct Unit Request" in a package that the Agency would provide.

[35] Later that same day, the Case Officer sent two follow-up emails. The first email [the Process Introduction Email] was provided three hours following the call. This introductory email included several important attachments: the Notice to Dispose, the Declaration of Infected Place, the Requirement to Quarantine, and a document titled What to Expect - Steps on How CFIA Will Work Through the Process on Your Farm. This last document explained that the entire administrative process of depopulation is "fluid" in that while it consists of well-defined discrete steps, these may overlap in practice. It also detailed the anticipated procedural steps, including discussions with the Case Officer, a lengthy Premises Investigation Questionnaire interview, biocontainment assessment, depopulation, disposal, cleaning and disinfection, and compensation.

[36] The second email [the Exemption Process Overview Email] detailing exemption requirements was sent four hours after the call. It outlined various requirements, including official guidance on exemptions for birds with "rare and valuable genetics," and reiterated that the process is "document heavy." It provided information on how to apply for an exemption from depopulation on this basis. The email reproduced relevant policy content regarding this category of exemption and explained that the assessment is based on both the submission of a completed Distinct Unit Request Package, which was attached to the email, and supporting evidence demonstrating the genetic value of the birds.

[37] Open and frequent communication between the Applicant and CFIA continued after the initial intake process. Following January 2, 2025, communications included virtual meetings, phone calls, emails, and a further on-site inspection. These interactions facilitated discussion and assessment of several key issues, including ostrich immunity, the genetic distinctiveness of the flock, the potential to identify an epidemiologically unexposed subgroup, and the farm's biosecurity conditions.

[38] On January 3, 2025, CFIA officials held a virtual meeting with the Applicant's principals to assist them in completing the Premises Investigation Questionnaire and to gather more information about the property. During the meeting, the son of one principal reported observing a neighbour entering areas already designated as an Infected Place. The Case Officer reminded the Applicant's principals of the importance of managing public perception, noting that their neighbours continued to contact the Agency with concerns about mortality management. The Case Officer emphasized the situation's urgency throughout the meeting, stressing the need for the Applicant to promptly submit evidence supporting their claimed relationship with Kyoto University and the asserted special genetic characteristics of the flock.

[39] On January 7, 2025, CFIA inspectors conducted another site visit at the Applicant's premises, which revealed further concerns with the biosecurity conditions at the farm. Inspectors observed wild ducks following them into the quarantine zone and noted the presence of weasels in the barns. More than 50 wild ducks were seen within one of the ostrich enclosures. Although the Applicant's principals had attempted to fence off a nearby pond, they explained that the wild ducks continued to access the ostrich feed dishes by flying in. The principals also sought guidance from the inspectors on completing the Distinct Unit Request Package. The inspectors reiterated the importance of submitting as much supporting evidence as possible to strengthen their exemption request.

[40] Between January 4 and 9, 2025, the Applicant submitted several documents to support its exemption application while ostrich deaths continued. The main document was the completed Distinct Unit Request Package. Other supporting documents included letters of support, and information detailing its business selling ostrich antibodies and other commercial ventures as support for the Applicant's claim that its ostriches should be exempted for their "rare and valuable genetics" worthy of preservation.

[41] On January 10, 2025, the CFIA issued the Exemption Denial. It concluded that the Applicant had failed to demonstrate the existence of any distinct epidemiological unit free from exposure risk. Additionally, the CFIA found that the Applicant had not submitted sufficient evidence to support its claims of genetic rarity and value qualifying the flock for an exemption.

[42] By mid-January 2025, the spread of illness had reportedly plateaued, although some ostriches remained ill or continued to die. CFIA officials continued to monitor the situation. By the end of January 2025, total ostrich mortalities tied to flu-like illness reportedly reached 69 birds. The Applicant alleges that the last death occurred on January 15, 2025, with the surviving majority appearing healthy or recovered. This reinforced its belief in the flock's attainment of at least partial herd immunity against H5N1.

[43] Late in January 2025, the Applicant requested permission to conduct or arrange additional tests on apparently healthy ostriches to confirm whether they were shedding virus. The Applicant also sought to have recognized genetic experts examine the flock. The record indicates the CFIA did not approve further testing at that stage. It focused instead on the confirmed H5N1-positive test results and reiterated the infection risk associated with an open-air ostrich operation like that of the Applicant's.

# IV. Decisions Below

[44] This judicial review arises from the CFIA's Notice to Dispose and its Exemption Denial. The Notice to Dispose mandates the destruction and disposal of the Applicant's ostriches, while the Exemption Denial refuses the Applicant's request that some or all the birds be spared. Together, these two decisions illustrate the CFIA's position that the Applicant's entire ostrich flock must be culled due to H5N1, with no exemption warranted. The underlying record includes not only the formal instruments themselves, but also supporting documentation such as meeting minutes, telephone call summaries, email correspondence, and internal memoranda. These materials together form the pertinent decision record before this Court.

[45] Before highlighting key aspects of the decision record, it is helpful to situate these decisions within the CFIA's broader administrative process that implements the disposal of animals and things contemplated by subsection 48(1) of the Act. The Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial are two steps in the multi-step process for containing and eradicating the current wave of HPAI, as set out in the 2022 ERP, which operationalizes the Stamping-Out Policy pursuant to the statutory discretion provided by subsection 48(1). The Notice initiates destruction of affected flocks based on established epidemiological criteria. The Exemption Denial serves as a secondary review that evaluates whether specific circumstances justify departing from the primary disease-control protocol.

## A. Notice to Dispose

[46] On December 31, 2024, the CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose requiring destruction of all poultry on the premises. This Agency did this through a Form 4202 Requirement to Dispose of Animals or Things, citing statutory authority under section 48 of the Act. This Order stated that "Avian Influenza" had been "determined or suspected" on the premises and required "all poultry and poultry carcasses along with other material approved by CFIA disposal crew" to be destroyed. The operative period ran from the date of the order to February 1, 2025. The Order treated ostriches as "poultry" for disease-control purposes. At this initial stage, the CFIA did not consider whether any portion of the flock might be exempted.

[47] On January 12, 2025, the CFIA issued an Amended Notice to Dispose, revoking and replacing the initial order of December 31, 2024, to correct several technical details without changing the ordered depopulation. This amendment corrected certain updated quarantine details, primarily the GPS coordinates, while leaving unchanged the substantive requirement to depopulate all ostriches and the original disposal timeline. The amended Order reaffirmed that ostriches fall under the classification of "poultry" for HPAI control purposes and reiterated that all listed animals and items remained subject to destruction. An accompanying explanatory note confirmed that the effective date of the original Notice to Dispose remained December 31, 2024.

[48] Immediately following the issuance of the original Notice to Dispose, the CFIA communicated with the Applicant providing further details regarding movement restrictions, quarantine measures, and the CFIA's avian influenza Stamping-Out Policy. While these additional communications did not add any new formal reasons, they clarified the administrative processes and reinforced the CFIA's position that full flock depopulation was mandatory unless an exemption was explicitly approved. On January 3, 2025, the CFIA Compensation Unit contacted the Applicant to provide information regarding compensation for the ordered destruction of the ostriches pursuant to Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations, SOR/2000-233 [the Compensation Regulations].

## B. Exemption Denial

[49] Following receipt of the Notice to Dispose, the Applicant sought exemption from depopulation claiming, first, that there is a distinct epidemiological unit within its flock that was either unexposed or at reduced risk and, second, that the flock contained "rare and valuable poultry genetics," which warranted preservation from complete depopulation. On January 10, 2025, the CFIA denied both exemption requests. Three sets of documents within the record are particularly significant in illustrating the CFIA's reasoning and decision-making process in evaluating and rejecting the Applicant's exemption request.

[50] The first set of documents consists of the Exemption Process Overview Email with the attached Distinct Unit Request Package, both dated January 2, 2025. This Email from the Case Officer and its attachment detailed the criteria for qualifying as a distinct epidemiological unit and listed the type of supporting documentation required for exemption under the "rare and valuable genetics" category. According to the Email, examples of acceptable documentation included historical records of genetic investment, evidence that the flock consists of high-quality purebred birds, and proof of genomic testing for specific traits.

[51] These documents were sent shortly after the Case Officer's initial intake phone call with the Applicant's principals, during which the principals expressed interest in seeking an exemption. In the Exemption Process Overview Email, the Case Officer invited the Applicant to submit supporting documentation for the exemption request, characterizing the application process as "document heavy." The Email reads:

Hello Again,
Sorry for the multiple emails!
This process is document heavy, but I'm here to help you navigate the process!

Based on the information we've gathered, you fall into the "birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics" category. I've copied CFIA's description here:

Rare and valuable genetics in poultry refers to uncommon genetic lines of poultry that hold a high economic value. Genetic breeding of poultry involves the creation of multi-generation genetically diverse populations on which selection is practiced to create adapted animals with new combinations of specific desirable traits. It is this combination of an uncommon breed or line of poultry, which undergoes a selection process to create specific desirable traits which leads to its high economic value.

# 3.1 Initial screening to classify birds as having rare and valuable genetics

The genetics of the flock can be demonstrated to be distinctive from standard commercial flocks with criteria such as but not limited to the following:

- There is historical evidence of genetic investment (e.g. breeding books, use of closed flocks of breeding pure line birds for a prolonged period, a selection program from trained geneticists is implemented);

- The flock consists of high quality pure-bred birds (e.g. are recognized by breed associations, 3rd party national/international organizations or by the poultry industry as top producers/prized genetics/suppliers of genetics);
- Genomics testing for specific traits has been undertaken

Here's what we need from you at this time to get started:

- We need documented proof that these birds are distinctive from standard commercial flocks. The highlighted section above gives good examples of the types of documents we're looking for.
- If you have any documentation of the agreement between you and the university - that'd be really helpful to send to us.
- I'll also need you guys to fill out the attached document Distinct Unit Package that will need to be completed and sent back to me.

Thanks,
[bold and italic in the original]

[52] The second set of documents comprises the Applicant's submissions supporting their exemption request. These documents, submitted to the CFIA Case Officer between January 2 and 10, 2025, included business plans highlighting research into ostrich antibodies, the potential commercialization of specific genetic lines, and assertions about the flock's unique African genetic heritage. They also contained diagrams illustrating the farm's physical layout, depicting fenced partitions and a large central natural pond, as well as letters from collaborators affirming the distinctiveness and commercial or research value of the flock.

[53] The third set of documents consists of the CFIA's formal communication of the denial and reasoning. This includes the Case Officer's January 10, 2025, email communicating the denial, the attached Response Letter providing formal reasons, and an Internal Recommendation Memorandum that formalized internal decision-making discussions. The email acknowledged the emotional distress that the Applicant's principals may experience and offered follow-up discussion opportunities with CFIA officials. The attached Response Letter explained that ostriches are "poultry" under its existing policy and the WOAH definitions, that selective disposal of birds would conflict with Canada's Stamping-Out obligations, and that the evidence did not satisfy the distinct epidemiological unit exemption threshold and the criteria for the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption. It concluded: "This decision is final and is not subject to appeal" [emphasis in the original].

[54] Informing the Exemption Denial was the Internal Recommendation Memorandum prepared and reviewed by the Exemption Committee. This Memorandum forms part of the Exemption Denial decision, as administrative decision-makers are entitled to adopt the reasoning of recommending bodies, such as the Exemption Committee, with the adopted reasoning being treated as that of the decision-makers: Canada (Attorney General) v Sketchley, 2005 FCA 404 at para 37-39.

[55] The Exemption Committee reviewed the Applicant's submissions and the Agency's internal policies and concluded there was "no evidence of a subset of birds existing as a distinct unit or at a different level of risk." This finding was based on site visits and documentation confirming that the Applicant's ostriches roamed outdoors across multiple pens, shared feed and staff, and frequently interacted with wild birds attracted to the central pond. Given the open layout of the farm, the shared equipment and staff, and the uniform risk of H5N1 transmission, the Committee concluded it was impractical to subdivide the flock for biosafety purposes, finding no distinct epidemiological units that could qualify for exemption.

[56] The Committee also determined that the Applicant failed to show the genetic uniqueness or economic value of the flock. The Exemption Committee highlighted that the Applicant had "a significant burden of proof... to demonstrate the high economic value the flock provides to the broader Canadian poultry industry" and the nature of the "robust processes ... to actively select and breed for specific desirable traits." The Committee concluded that the Applicant had not met either requirement based on the evidence it had provided. Additionally, the Committee conducted an analysis on trade implications of non-adoption or non-implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy and wrote about a preliminary scientific literature review indicating that ostriches can harbour and spread sub-clinical H5N1 and potentially facilitate further viral mutations and reassortments.

[57] Collectively, these documents articulate this rationale: ostriches, classified as poultry under Canadian avian influenza control policies, must be destroyed pursuant to the WOAHsupported Stamping-Out Policy upon confirmation of HPAI infection unless strict exemption criteria are met. Based on this rationale, the CFIA determined the Applicant's flock was uniformly exposed to risk and concluded the Applicant failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the exemption criteria.

## C. Injunction

[58] The Applicant filed a motion to enjoin the CFIA from enforcing the Notice to Dispose and the Requirement to Quarantine. By Order dated January 31, 2025, this Court stayed the Notice to Dispose "until a decision is rendered in the underlying application for judicial review." The Requirement to Quarantine was left untouched.

# V. Issues

[59] The Applicant identifies five issues in their written submissions:

1) The applicable standard of review;
2) Whether the CFIA properly exercised its discretion in issuing the Notice to Dispose;
3) Whether the CFIA breached procedural fairness in making the Exemption Denial;
4) Whether the CFIA properly applied its own exemption criteria; and
5) Whether the CFIA properly exercised its discretion in issuing the Exemption Denial.

[60] At the hearing, the Applicant raised two novel issues, both bearing on the reasonableness of the CFIA's implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy in the Applicant's specific circumstances. First, whether the CFIA relied on an incorrect factual assumption about the pathogenicity of the virus in deciding to apply the Policy. Second, whether the CFIA's classification of the farm's ostriches as "poultry" was incorrect and, if so, whether that misclassification rendered its application of the Policy unreasonable.

[61] The Respondent proposes a different three-part framing of the issues:

1) Should portions of the five expert reports filed by the Applicant be struck;
2) Was the Notice reasonable and issued in a procedurally fair manner; and
3) Was the Exemption Refusal reasonable and made in a procedurally fair manner.

[62] Although neither party's framing fully captures the scope and complexity of the issues in this judicial review, I find two submissions made by the Respondent's counsel at the hearing particularly helpful in structuring the analysis. First, the Respondent correctly points out that the Applicant devotes significant attention to challenging the reasonableness of the Stamping-Out Policy itself. Hence, addressing the reasonableness of the Policy as a distinct issue yields a clearer and more logical analysis. Second, the Respondent's conceptual distinction between the formulation and implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy strikes at the heart of this case. Treating these as distinct parts to be analyzed, each subject to different contextual factors and judicial review considerations, provides a more coherent and analytically sound framework.

[63] Accordingly, this Court frames the issues as follows:

1. Whether the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy, as currently operationalized through the 2022 ERP policy document, is reasonable in law?
2. Whether the CFIA's implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy was reasonable and procedurally fair given the Applicant's specific circumstances?
   2.1. Whether the Notice to Dispose was made through a fair process, unfettered, and reasonable?
   2.2. Whether the Exemption Denial was made through a fair process and reasonable?

[64] Finally, this Court also needs to address several evidentiary objections raised by both parties. These include admissibility and weight to be afforded to portions of each other's expert reports, certain challenged parts of the affidavit of Dr. Cathy Furness submitted by the Respondent, and the challenge to the reliability of the Respondent's Report of Inspector, authored and signed by Inspector Dykstra on January 31, 2025.

# VI. Standard of Review

## A. The fundamentals

[65] The parties submit that the applicable standard for review of procedural fairness is correctness. However, based on the jurisprudence, I find a more accurate characterization to be one that resembles the correctness standard but shifts the focus from determining the correct procedure to assessing "whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances": Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 [Canadian Pacific] at para 54; Heiltsuk Horizon Maritime Services Ltd v Atlantic Towing Limited, 2021 FCA 26 at para 107. The goal of the procedural fairness review should always be investigating "the ultimate question [of] whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond": Canadian Pacific at para 56.

[66] For substantive review, I agree with the parties that the CFIA's decisions to issue the Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness, as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Vavilov.

[67] Reasonableness review is one single deferential yet robust standard: Vavilov at paras 12-13 and 89. The Court must give considerable deference to the decision-maker, recognizing that this entity is empowered by Parliament and equipped with specialized knowledge and understanding of the "purposes and practical realities of the relevant administrative regime" and "consequences and the operational impact of the decision" that the reviewing court may not be attentive towards: Vavilov at para 93. Judicial intervention is warranted only when the flaws or shortcomings are "sufficiently serious... such that [the decision] cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency:" Vavilov at para 100. Absent exceptional circumstances, reviewing courts must not interfere with the decision maker's factual findings and cannot reweigh and reassess evidence considered by the decision-maker: Vavilov at para 125.

[68] However, reasonableness review is not a mere "rubber-stamping" process: Vavilov at para 13. It is the reviewing court's task to assess whether the decision as a whole is reasonable; that is, it is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision-maker: Vavilov at para 85.

[69] A court conducting reasonableness review is not, and must not become, an "academy of science": Coldwater First Nation v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 34 [Coldwater First Nation] at para 119; Inverhuron \& District Ratepayers Ass. v Canada (Minister of The Environment), 2001 FCA 203 [Inverhuron] at para 40. When conducting reasonableness review of decisions involving highly scientific and technical subject matters, courts must pay careful attention to the decision-maker's expertise: Vavilov at paras 92 and 93. This expertise warrants judicial deference in the assessment of facts: Vavilov at para 125; Safe Food Matters Inc. v Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 1471 [Safe Food Matters] at para 121; Dias v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 126 at para 8. Similarly, deference is also warranted in the interpretation of law, particularly when it pertains to the decision-maker's home statutes: Safe Food Matters at paras 8 and 111; Balogh v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 447 at para 18. However, such expertise must be demonstrated by the decision-makers for the judiciary to afford it deference: Vavilov at para 93; Mason v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at para 70.

[70] In addition to considering the administrative decision-maker's demonstrated expertise, the relevant evidentiary record, and the applicable legal framework, reviewing courts must also pay attention to the impact of the decision on those affected by its consequences. This dimension of judicial scrutiny has been brought to the forefront of reasonableness review by the Supreme Court in paragraphs 133 to 135 of Vavilov: "concerns regarding arbitrariness will generally be more acute in cases where the consequences of the decision for the affected party are particularly severe or harsh, and a failure to grapple with such consequences may well be unreasonable."

## B. Reasonableness review of policy decisions

[71] The context of administrative decisions shapes what constitutes reasonable decision-making, even though it does not alter the standard of review itself. As established in Vavilov at paragraph 89, although context does "not modulate the standard or the degree of scrutiny by the reviewing court," it does "constrain [...] what will be reasonable for an administrative decision maker to decide in a given case." This distinction means that while courts must apply consistent analytical rigour for judicial reviews of all administrative decisions, the outcomes of a reasonableness review will necessarily vary depending on the decision-making context, with "some decisions [being] more likely to survive reasonableness review because they are relatively unconstrained," while "other decisions may be less likely to survive because they are relatively more constrained": Entertainment Software Association v Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2020 FCA 100 [Entertainment Software] at para 25.

[72] Policy decisions fall into the "very much unconstrained" category and therefore are "harder to set aside": Entertainment Software at paras 24-28 and 31. They typically require balancing of complex social, scientific, economic, and public interest considerations, which are better left for the executive branch of the government and its various administrative arms. This is particularly true for policy decisions establishing general frameworks "without reference to particular cases," as they are even less adjudicative and administrative in nature. Importantly, courts should not recast such decisions as administrative acts merely because certain actors may experience a sharper economic impact than others: South Shore Trading Co. Ltd. v Canada (Fisheries, Oceans and Coast Guard), 2025 FC 174 [South Shore] at paras 44-48.

[73] Historically, judicial intervention in policy decisions has been limited to specific, narrow grounds. Precedents such as Maple Lodge Farms v Government of Canada, [1982] 2 SCR 2 [Maple Lodge Farm], have established that courts may interfere only where the policy is tainted by bad faith, breaches an express requirement of statutory natural justice, or relies on considerations that are "irrelevant or extraneous" to the statute's purpose: South Shore at para 50, citing Maple Lodge Farms at pp 7-8.

[74] The Supreme Court of Canada has now folded these traditional grounds for intervention into Vavilov's unified reasonableness framework. In Auer v. Auer, 2024 SCC 36 [Auer], the Supreme Court established that subordinate legislation, such as regulations, is presumptively reviewed for reasonableness. The "irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated" test from Katz Group Canada Inc. v Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, now functions merely as a reminder that subordinate rules must remain within the enabling statute's boundaries, rather than as a separate threshold distinct from Vavilov's framework: Auer at paras 29-36, 41-47 and 50-65. At paragraphs 59 to 65 of Auer, the Supreme Court stressed that "the governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law and the principles of statutory interpretation are particularly relevant constraints" under reasonableness review. The central question for reviewing courts is whether the impugned instrument can plausibly be located within the purpose, text, and overall architecture of the enabling statute. Weighing the substantive merits of policymaking is strictly off limits: Auer at paras 55-58.

[75] Although Auer addressed specifically decisions to make subordinate legislation, its reasoning logically extends to policymaking decisions. The key connective tissue is the source of authority: in both contexts, the decision-maker exercises broad, delegated discretionary power to pursue legislative objectives. Vavilov has identified the governing statute, other relevant law, and factual context as the "legal and factual constraints" on every administrative act: Vavilov at paras 105-135. Therefore, whether discretion manifests through formal regulations or through general policy directives, administrative decision-makers must always interpret their enabling provisions purposively, act within statutory boundaries, and demonstrate that their legislative or quasi-legislative actions advance the statutory objectives given the available legal and factual constraints.

[76] Consequently, the core reasonableness review considerations articulated in Auer should also apply to policymaking decisions. The analytical framework should not turn on the formal label of "regulation." What matters most is the nature of the decision itself. Specifically, whether it creates generally applicable rules on statutory authority to be applied by more frontline decision-makers in the administrative decision-making chain. This description encompasses ministerial directives, Cabinet guidelines, and disease-control policies no less than regulations. Accordingly, the analytical framework in Auer that includes the principles of presumption of validity, purposive interpretation, and prohibition on merits review should also guide courts reviewing any policymaking decision. Ultimately, the inquiry remains whether the decision to adopt the policy instrument is grounded in a rational, purposive interpretation of the enabling statute and respects all relevant procedural, substantive, and contextual limits.

[77] Deference is particularly warranted for policy decisions intended to safeguard animal and public health from high-risk disease. Case law has shown this principle consistently. In Kohl v Canada (Department of Agriculture), [1995] FCJ No. 1076 (FCA) [Kohl], the Federal Court of Appeal described a ministerial order made under section 48 of the Act as a "policy decision obviously not subject to the requirements of the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness," reviewable solely for abuse or misuse of power: Kohl at para 18.

[78] The teaching from Kohl is clear. Where a policy decision ordering blanket disposal of affected animals and things is made in good faith, reviewing courts should confine their reasonableness analysis to whether the destruction advances the objectives of the Act and whether there is some evidence to support the underlying suspicion. Following Vavilov, the threshold for finding sufficient support today is undoubtedly reasonableness, meaning the question is whether the suspicion is reasonably supported by the evidence and consistent with applicable legal constraints. Substituting a different view of the scientific and operational determinations underlying the policy decision would risk treading on the executive's policy prerogative: Kohl at paras 20-22.

[79] Entertainment Software, South Shore, Kohl and Auer converge into a single guiding principle: courts serve as guardians of legality, not arbiters of the wisdom of policy. When the legislature explicitly delegates public interest decisions, such as the management of animal and public health, to administrative actors, courts must leave assessment of policy merits, especially the nuanced balancing of scientific, economic, and social factors, to decision-makers tasked by Parliament with those responsibilities. Judicial review of policy decisions should only target compliance with legal and factual constraints, and verification of whether the alleged exercise of technical expertise in formulating the policy decisions has been sufficiently demonstrated.

# VII. Legal Framework

## A. The law and policy on disposal of affected or contaminated animals and things

### (1) The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme

[80] Under the Act, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food [the Minister] holds significant powers to manage diseases in animals. These powers advance the Act's core objectives by proactively preventing and controlling animal diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans, thereby protecting public health and preserving Canada's international trade status: River Valley Poultry Farm Ltd v Canada (Attorney General), 2009 ONCA 326 [River Valley Poultry Farm] at para 68; Paradis Honey Ltd v Canada (Agriculture and Agri-Food), 2024 FC 1921 [Paradis Honey] at para 23; Jerram v Canada (Minister of Agriculture) (T.D.), [1994] 3 FC 17 [Jerram] at para 30; Kohl at paras 7-12.

[81] The Act provides multiple tools for containing disease outbreaks, including infected place declarations, quarantines, and control zones. The Minister and their delegates have authority to declare infected places under sections 22 to 23, impose quarantines per section 25, and establish primary control zones pursuant to section 27. These declarations trigger strict prohibitions against the movement of animals or related items within or out of affected areas without a licence to facilitate swift containment of potential outbreaks. Notably, Parliament has anticipated the need for broad and proactive containment measures. As such, under subsection 22(2), control orders automatically extend not only to directly affected premises but also to adjacent lands, buildings, or properties owned or occupied by the same individual.

[82] Central to this judicial review is section 48 of the Act. Subsection 48(1) empowers the Minister and their delegates to order the destruction of animals or things in three scenarios: (a) if the animal is infected, suspected of infection, or contaminated by a disease or toxic substance; (b) if the animal has been in contact with or in proximity to an infected animal or thing; or (c) if the animal itself is a vector, causative agent, or toxic substance. Enforcement is governed by subsection 48(3), which mandates a written "Notice to Dispose" specifying the timeline and method of destruction. Compliance is compulsory, as failure to act permits authorities to directly dispose of the animals. Subsection 48(2) offers an alternative to destruction, allowing treatment instead, but only where the Minister is satisfied that treatment will "eliminate or prevent the spread" of the disease or toxic substance.

[83] Parliament has clearly conferred broad discretion on the Minister and their delegates under section 48 of the Act. The Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that even a mere suspicion of exposure, without confirmed contamination, is sufficient to justify issuing a Notice to Dispose under the Act: Kohl at para 20. This broad latitude is also reflected in Parliament's use of the permissive language "may." However, this discretion is limited to a functional binary of destruction and treatment. Within this framework, the discretion focuses on two key decisions: (1) whether to order destruction or authorize treatment; and (2) how to carry out the chosen course of action. The statute leaves no room for a third "wait-and-see" approach. Interpreting section 48 to allow for such an option would violate the "well established principle of statutory interpretation that the legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences," which include situations where an interpretation "is incompatible with other provisions or with the object of the legislative enactment": Rizzo \& Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 SCR 27 at para 27. Given the Act's objectives of proactive disease prevention and control, a "wait-and-see" approach, unless it can be reasonably nested under a destruction or treatment plan, would undermine those core mandates and result in precisely the kind of incompatible interpretation the law forbids.

[84] Moreover, discretion under the treatment option is narrowly circumscribed by scientific and operational realities. Subsection 48(2) explicitly limits treatment to situations "where the Minister considers that the treatment will be effective in eliminating or preventing" the spread of disease. This means that the Minister and their delegates' discretion to authorize treatment is therefore limited by scientific and operational realities: they must have confidence that treatment is both scientifically viable and practically feasible. Consequently, where the Minister and their delegates determine that treatment provided by subsection 48(2) of the Act cannot reliably eradicate or prevent the spread of a high-risk disease, the Act effectively compels the ordering of destruction contemplated by subsection 48(1).

[85] Recognizing that the CFIA's mandate is protective rather than punitive, the Act also balances depopulation requirements with compensation to affected animal owners. Specifically, under subsection 51(1) of the Act, owners whose animals are destroyed or die after being required to be destroyed are entitled to compensation calculated based on the animal's market value prior to destruction, less any residual value in the carcasses. Nevertheless, this market valuation is subject to regulatory caps provided by the Compensation Regulations. Specifically, pursuant to subsection 2(a) and the associated Schedule, compensation for an ostrich is limited to a maximum of $3,000 per animal. The compensation framework also extends beyond the value of the animals themselves. Subsection 51(4) of the Act permits additional compensation for disposal-related costs, which, as specified by subsection 3(1) of the Compensation Regulations, may include reasonable costs of transportation, slaughter, cleaning and disinfection, disposal services, and personal labour expended by the owner.

[86] Importantly, this compensation scheme is no-fault in nature and tied to compliance with CFIA directives. Compensation becomes payable after destruction pursuant to section 48 of the Act. In this way, the framework encourages timely cooperation with the Agency's disease control measures while recognizing the significant economic impact borne by owners whose flocks must be sacrificed in the interest of protecting the broader public good.

### (2) The Jurisprudence on the Act's Objective and the Decision-Maker's Discretion

[87] This Court has long recognized that, when faced with urgent threats to animal health, public safety, or economic interests, the Minister and their delegates are entitled to adopt drastic measures that may seriously and adversely impact individuals affected by the decision, particularly in economic terms. As Justice Cullen recognized in David Hunt Farms Ltd v Canada (Minister of Agriculture), 1994 CarswellNat 1859 (FC TD) [David Hunt FC] at para 51, the authorities may legitimately pursue an "admittedly draconian approach," provided it is pursued in good faith and for legitimate public-interest objectives. In such circumstances, the broader public interest in disease-control prevails over individual property rights, especially given the statutory compensation mechanisms available under section 51 of the Act: David Hunt FC at para 52.

[88] The jurisprudence further makes clear that the Minister's discretion under subsection 48(1) includes the power to develop general policy directives, the implementation of which is delegated to subordinate officials: David Hunt FC at para 43, aff'd David Hunt Farms Ltd v Canada (Minister of Agriculture), 1994 CarswellNat 1876 (FCA) [David Hunt FCA] at paras 4-5, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused [1994] SCCA No. 353; Carpenter Fishing Corp. v. Canada, [1997] FCJ No 1811 (FCA) [Carpenter Fishing] at paras 28-29. This principle reflects the recognized distinction between two types of discretion under the Act: a broad discretion involving the formulation of general policy, and a constrained discretion exercised by officials responsible for implementing that policy.

[89] This distinction gives rise to a two-phase framework for understanding the exercise of discretion under subsection 48(1). In the first phase, at the ministerial level, the Minister exercises broad discretion to formulate general policies governing the control of animal diseases. As Justice Cullen noted in paragraph 43 of David Hunt FC, "section 48(1) vests the discretion to require the disposal of animals in the Minister, not in a person such as an inspector, or a District Veterinarian." In the second phase, at the administrative level, frontline officials implement the policies established by the Minister, typically exercising little to no independent discretion. This division mirrors the approach identified by the Federal Court of Appeal in Carpenter Fishing at paragraph 28, where the Court explicitly distinguished between "the imposition of a quota policy" as "a discretionary decision in the nature of policy or legislative action" and "the granting of a specific license" as an administrative action.

[90] This two-phase structure aligns with established administrative law principles and ensures operational feasibility. The structure conforms with principles distinguishing between the more permissible delegation of administrative tasks and the more problematic delegation of quasi-legislative or judicial functions: The Queen v Harrison, [1977] 1 SCR 238 at p 245; Re Peralta and the Queen, [1985] OJ No 2304 at paras 63-73; The Dene Nation v The Queen, [1984] 2 FC 942 at p 947. Practically, requiring the Minister to personally make every decision concerning animal health across the country would be unworkable and inconsistent with the need for an efficient and effective animal disease response system. By allowing the Minister and their delegates to set general policy and entrust its routine implementation to officials, the two-phased statutory scheme promotes operational feasibility and consistency in a large tribunal like the Agency, which exercises discretionary powers with significant consequences for Canadians: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Thamotharem, 2007 FCA 198 [Thamotharem] at para 60. As the case law recognizes, the adoption and application of general policies are both permissible and desirable, provided such policies are not applied blindly and the decision-maker remains attentive to specific circumstances: Carpenter Fishing at para 29.

[91] The distinction between policy formulation and implementation has real impacts on judicial review. First, reviewing courts must carefully differentiate between the review of general policy decisions, which are more quasi-legislative in nature, and the review of specific decisions implementing those policies, which are more administrative in nature. As the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized in Carpenter Fishing at paragraph 29, courts must not apply the standards of review appropriate to administrative decisions when assessing legislative policymaking. The Federal Court of Appeal further instructed that, where a challenge to an administrative decision indirectly attacks an underlying policy, courts should isolate the policy component and apply standards appropriate to legislative action. Consequently, courts afford greater deference to general policy decisions, while applying more rigorous scrutiny to their specific administrative application.

[92] Second, the obligations of procedural fairness also vary depending on whether the exercise of administrative discretion involves general policy formulation or specific administrative implementation. Decisions grounded in high-level policy formulation, especially at ministerial or institutional levels, and aimed explicitly at the public interest typically trigger minimal procedural protections for individuals, with the generally viable route being challenges on grounds of abuse of discretion: David Hunt FC at para 52, citing Martineau v Matsqui Disciplinary Board, [1980] 1 SCR 602 at 628-629; Kohl at paras 19-21. In contrast, decisions that are "not of a legislative nature," delegated to frontline officials, and directly "affect[ing] the rights, privileges, or interests of an individual," attract heightened procedural fairness obligations: Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, [1985] 2 SCR 643 [Cardinal] at para 14; Knight v Indian Head School Division No. 19, [1990] 1 SCR 653 at p. 670; Blois v. Onion Lake Cree Nation, 2020 FC 953 at para 69.

### (3) The "Stamping-Out" Policy

#### (a) Overview

[93] The Stamping-Out Policy is Canada's adaptation of internationally recognized and applied principles for managing HPAI outbreaks. It prioritizes swift elimination of infected populations rather than individual testing and disposal of affected animals. Adopted during and developed following Canada's first HPAI outbreak in British Columbia in 2004, the Policy aligns with three sequential steps of the stamping-out approach outlined by the World Organisation for Animal Health, Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Paris: WOAH, 2024) [Terrestrial Code]: killing affected animals and those suspected of exposure, disposing of carcasses, and cleansing and disinfecting establishments. Rather than prescribing detailed operational procedures, the Stamping-Out Policy sets only high-level guidance, with specific implementation protocols developed through instruments that translate the broader Policy into individual processes and actionable steps at the field level. This approach has been maintained as a directive of general applicability across different outbreak scenarios, with implementation triggered by specific conditions. Currently, the trigger is defined in the 2022 ERP as laboratory confirmation of H5-subtype HPAI detection in domestic birds within a defined epidemiological unit.

[94] Since its inception, the Stamping-Out Policy has been consistently implemented by the CFIA as its primary strategy for managing HPAI outbreaks. Previously formalized in the 2007 and 2013 Notifiable Avian Influenza Hazard-Specific Plans [the NAI HSPs] and now operationalized through the 2022 ERP, the Policy has been found by the Agency to be the most successful method for eradicating viruses, eliminating environmental contamination, halting transmission, and reducing public health risks. The 2022 ERP sets out a flexible set of guidelines informed by past decisions, and is intended to: 1) cover situations not addressed by an existing policy; 2) allow deviation from or modification of an existing policy; 3) clarify existing policy; or 4) provide a range of adaptable policy options in varying decision-making contexts. Along with other guidelines, this instrument is regularly refined and amended, particularly when sufficiently unique situations necessitate more tailored response mechanisms.

[95] The Stamping-Out Policy's legal foundation rests in both subsection 48(1) of the Act and the long-established administrative law principle that agencies may use "soft law" instruments to guide the exercise of their discretion without requiring an express statutory mandate: Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2020 FCA 196 at para 45, citing Thamotharem at para 56. Scientifically and operationally, the Policy is informed by international standards, particularly those set by WOAH, and by scientific research and practical considerations tailored to Canada's agricultural, biosafety, and economic realities. Canada's international commitments and trade agreements also guide the design of the Stamping-Out Policy. They also further reinforce and incentivize the consistent domestic application of the Policy to protect its international reputation and maintain market access.

[96] The Stamping-Out Policy operates as an automatic response protocol once triggered, with discretion reserved for exemptions. The overall process of administering the Policy is multistepped. In practice, the very first step of exercising discretion granted under subsection 48(1) to decide whether to destroy or to treat HPAI-infected animals has already been done at the stage when the CFIA, as a delegate of the Minister, decided to develop and adopt the Stamping-Out Policy. As a result, once a triggering laboratory result arises, the Policy functions more as an automatic response protocol rather than an occasion for fresh discretionary judgment. At that point, the roles of relevant CFIA officials are to implement the established procedures for the depopulation and destruction of animals and things, not to decide anew how to respond. As part of this process, the CFIA must define the epidemiological unit, which by default encompasses birds on the entire premises unless scientific evidence justifies a narrower designation. Once such unit is determined, all remaining steps follow according to the prescribed protocol: depopulation, disposal, and disinfection of the entire unit, along with the surveillance periods consistent with WOAH standards. Discretion remains available, however, through the exemption process, where the CFIA evaluates on a case-by-case basis whether certain birds can be exempted under one of three narrow categories.

[97] This predominantly automatic approach, with discretion reserved for case-specific exemptions, reflects the scientific and operational realities of managing HPAI outbreaks: to counteract a virus with high transmissibility, capacity for rapid spread prior to visible clinical symptoms, and potential to seriously harm Canada's animal health, human health, and international trade interests. This unique decision-making context drives the Stamping-Out Policy's prioritization of immediate containment and depopulation to prevent further spread. It also explains why both Parliament and the judiciary have consistently endorsed the proactive, preventive philosophy underpinning both the Act and the relevant jurisprudence such as the David Hunt cases, Kohl, Paradis Honey, and River Valley Poultry Farm.

#### (b) International Obligations and Trade Implications

[98] The adoption and operationalization of the Stamping-Out Policy reflects Canada's commitment to fulfill binding international obligations, rather than mere domestic policy preference. Annex A(3)(b) of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures has designated the WOAH as the authoritative international standard-setting body for animal health. Unsurprisingly, Canada's major trade agreements, including Article 9.6 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement and Chapter 5 of the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, explicitly incorporate selected WOAH standards and condition market access to Canada's trading partners on demonstrated compliance with specific WOAH protocols.

[99] Non-compliance with the Stamping-Out Policy can cause severe national economic consequences through extended trade restrictions in at least two ways. First, Article 10.4.3 of the Terrestrial Code establishes dramatically different waiting periods for regaining HPAI-free status: only 28 days after completing stamping-out and disinfection, versus a minimum of 12 months if stamping-out is not implemented. If the Policy is not adopted or observed, this extended trade restriction period can devastate not just individual farming operations but potentially a significant portion of Canada's agricultural export sector.

[100] Second, proper adoption and observation of the Stamping-Out Policy are the bedrocks of Canada's negotiated regional containment zoning agreements, which limit trade impacts to specific geographical areas during outbreaks while allowing exports to continue from unaffected regions. Dr. Suminder Sawhney, Senior Director of Animal Import and Export at CFIA, confirms that deviations from the Policy, even for smaller-scale outbreaks involving uncommon species, could invalidate entire agreements. The resulting comprehensive trade bans could impose economic costs far exceeding the immediate costs of containing individual outbreaks and harm the broader Canadian poultry industry, not just the affected premises.

#### (c) Operationalization through the 2022 ERP: Trigger and Implementation

[101] The 2022 ERP is the latest instrument that operationalizes the Stamping-Out Policy. Section 7.1 of the 2022 ERP sets out the triggering mechanism for implementing the Stamping-Out Policy, which varies depending on whether the case is the first occurrence, known as an index case, in a province or a subsequent detection in the same province. For an index case, the policy requires both H5 detection and pathotyping confirmation of the level of pathogenicity at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg. For any subsequent cases within the same province, any H5 RRT-PCR positive result from a Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network approved laboratory immediately activates the Policy without requiring pathotyping.

[102] When triggered, the Policy applies uniformly to all domestic birds susceptible to avian influenza, regardless of species characteristics. Section 7.3 of the 2022 ERP states: "The classification of an IP [Infected Premises] as non-poultry does not change the eradication actions required on the IP. These will be the same as for an IP classified as non-commercial (small holding) poultry." While the 2022 ERP does distinguish between "Commercial poultry," "Non-commercial poultry," and "Non-poultry," these classifications of Infected Premises affect only trade reporting, zoning requirements, and surveillance protocols. They do not alter the fundamental eradication measures applied to the premises itself. As section 7.6 of the 2022 ERP confirms, "Regardless of the classification of an IP (7.3), individual IP actions include application of stamping out measures." Susceptibility to avian influenza - not size, commercial value, rarity, or expected lifespan - is the sole determining factor for whether a particular species falls within the Policy's scope. Consequently, all susceptible birds - from common farm species like chickens and turkeys to less frequently domesticated birds like emus and ostriches - face the same depopulation protocol when H5 or H7 is detected in an epidemiological unit.

[103] Critical to proper implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy is the determination of the "epidemiological unit," which the 2022 ERP defines in Section 7.2 as: "A group of animals with the same likelihood of exposure to the pathogenic agent." By default, this encompasses the entire premises, unless evidence demonstrates that smaller units maintain physical and functional separation. In essence, this determination of an epidemiological unit represents a scientific assessment of exposure risk, not individual animal infection status. Once the CFIA defines the unit, every bird within it must be destroyed, except for three strictly defined exemption categories, and the environment must undergo the depopulation, disposal, and disinfection measures prescribed in the 2022 ERP Sections 7.6 through 7.8.

[104] Once triggered, the Stamping-Out Policy mandates a structured sequence of three operational phases that closely mirror those described by the Terrestrial Code. Sections 7.6 to 7.8 of the 2022 ERP outline these steps. First, depopulation requires humanely destroying all birds in the identified epidemiological unit using CFIA-approved methods. Second, disposal requires securely eliminating all carcasses and contaminated materials through biosecure methods that prevent environmental contamination. Third, premises must undergo primary cleaning and disinfection or, where infeasible, an extended 120-day fallow period at temperatures below 4°C for natural viral inactivation. These steps progress through a structured sequence: 1) completing the destruction phase permits disposal operations; 2) properly disposing of carcasses reduces airborne risk sufficiently to allow bird placement outside infected premises and begins a 14-day surveillance period in the surrounding control zone; 3) finishing the cleaning and disinfection phase triggers duty to notify WOAH of outbreak closure and initiates a 28-day surveillance period in the broader control area; and 4) either a 14-day post-cleaning vacancy period or 120-day fallow period permits lifting all restrictions and quarantine orders.

#### (d) Exemption Framework and Assessment Criteria

[105] The 2022 ERP permits three narrow exemptions from depopulation required by the Stamping-Out Policy under specific scientifically defensible circumstances: "distinct units," "rare and valuable genetics," and "pet birds." Conceptually speaking, this exemption does not constitute a detachment of the birds in question from the Policy itself, but rather excludes said birds from the epidemiological unit to which depopulation must be applied. Pursuant to sections 7.2.1 and 7.6 as well as the Exemptions from depopulation appendix of the 2022 ERP, these exemptions all share a common threshold requirement: the birds must constitute a distinct epidemiological unit with no exposure to the virus.

[106] In addition to the basic requirement of a distinct epidemiological unit, each of the three exemption categories also has specific qualifying criteria. For "distinct units," a portion of an infected premises may qualify for exemption if it maintains both physical and functional separation from the rest of the premises. This requires demonstrating separation through factors such as dedicated ventilation systems, physical barriers, separate staff, and biosecurity protocols preventing cross-contamination. For "rare and valuable genetics," poultry lines must demonstrate high economic or genetic value and maintain status as a distinct epidemiological unit. For "pet birds," exemptions may apply where birds are kept indoors, remain clinically healthy, and form a distinct epidemiological unit separate from the exposed population.

[107] A brief clarification is warranted to avoid confusion of the similarly named terms of "distinct unit" and "distinct epidemiological unit." While closely related, these terms are not interchangeable, and thus have important differences in application. Unlike "distinct unit," which typically requires physical and infrastructural separation, "distinct epidemiological unit" turns on demonstrated epidemiological independence. This can be shown through strict health monitoring, assigned staff, and rigorous biosecurity protocols that prevent exposure to the pathogen. In practice, however, achieving this level of epidemiological independence will often require many of the same physical and functional separations associated with a "distinct unit."

[108] Assessment of exemption requests follows a rigorous, evidence-based, and discretionary process. Interdisciplinary committees like the Exemption Committee evaluate applications filled out by applicants against twenty distinct criteria related to physical separation, operational biosecurity, and risk management. As indicated on the self-assessment questionnaire in the Distinct Unit Request Package itself, any "NO" answers to these criteria likely precludes exemption. Additionally, the committees also weigh international trade and public health implications before granting an exemption. Furthermore, any exemption granted is automatically void if subsequent testing detects infection in the exempted birds, triggering the immediate application of the full Stamping-Out Policy to the previously exempted birds.

[109] The CFIA has strictly observed this distinct epidemiological unit threshold requirement in its evaluation of exemption applications. To date, it has granted only one exemption during the current outbreak: a March 2022 decision on a turkey production facility [the March 2022 Exemption]. In that case, CFIA ordered the destruction of turkeys in only two barns, while sparing those in other barns on the same premises. This limited exemption was justified by multiple biosafety measures establishing demonstrated epidemiological separation: 1) each grow-out barn maintained "distinct/separate air space in regards to ventilation"; 2) the facility implemented "various biosecurity measures...to mitigate the risk of transmission between other flocks/barns," including "shower in/shower out procedures, dedicated clothing, footwear, equipment"; and 3) "official CFIA control mechanisms... have been placed on the premise." Only after establishing the existence of a distinct epidemiological unit did the CFIA proceed to evaluate whether the facility qualified for the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption. It concluded that the spared turkeys met this criterion, as they were "high value pedigree birds that are the genetic cornerstone for the further production of commercial turkeys."

## B. The law on fettering

[110] Fettering is a serious flaw in administrative decision-making. It unlawfully removes or abandons the discretion that legislatures intended to be exercised in relation to individual cases: Vavilov at para 108, citing Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Lukács, 2018 SCC 2 at para 18. Fettering occurs when decision-makers blindly follow soft law instruments as if they were binding law, without genuinely considering how to exercise their discretion in the specific circumstances: Thamotharem at para 62; Stemijon Investments Ltd v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 299 [Stemijon Investments] at para 22, citing Maple Lodge Farms at p 6.

[111] However, merely showing that decision-makers were "influenced significantly by... policy and its objectives" falls short of establishing the requisite "blindness" to constitute fettering, as influence alone does not show that decision-makers "afforded no consideration to the possibility of" pursuing an alternative course: Publicover v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 659 at para 54; Thamotharem at para 59. Applicants bear the burden of showing that the decision-maker treated the policy as binding, ignoring their duty to exercise independent judgment based on the facts of each case: Shin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FC 1106.

[112] Once a court finds that discretion has been fettered, the decision must be set aside, as "a decision that is the product of a fettered discretion must per se be unreasonable:" Stemijon Investments at para 24; Barco v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 421 at para 20; Gordon v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 643 at para 28. No degree of deference can cure the flaw that flows from fettering.

[113] The prevailing view is that fettering does not engage a standard of review analysis in the usual sense. While some cases, such as Singh Bajwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 864 at para 46 have suggested that correctness may apply, the now prevailing view in the Federal Courts is that the core question is simply whether the decision was, in fact, the result of fettered discretion: Desgagnés Transarctik Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 14 at para 65; Austin v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1277 at para 16; Matharoo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 664 at para21; Yanasik v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 1319 at para 25.

[114] The Federal Courts have identified key factors to watch for within policy instruments for distinguishing between permissible guidance and impermissible fettering. In paragraph 64 of Thamotharem, the Federal Court of Appeal endorsed the approach from Ainsley Financial Corp. v Ontario Securities Commission, [1994] OJ No 2966 [Ainsley], which examines: 1) the language of the instrument; 2) the practical effect of non-compliance; and 3) the expectations of the agency and its staff regarding implementation. A policy that uses mandatory language, prescribes detailed procedures, threatens sanctions for non-compliance, and is treated by staff as binding law, is more likely to amount to fettering. The key question is whether a decision is made "solely by reference to the mandatory prescription of a guideline, despite a request to deviate from it in the light of the particular facts:" Thamotharem at para 62.

[115] Two Federal Court cases applying section 48 of the Act have further clarified the distinction between permissible policy guidance and impermissible fettering in the multi-step decision-making of infected animal disposal. In David Hunt FC, Justice Cullen found that fettering cannot arise where no independent judgment remained at the implementation level. That case involved a district veterinarian tasked with destroying cattle imported from the United Kingdom. The destruction decision followed a pre-established blanket policy directing that all cattle imported before 1990 be culled. Because the Minister had already made a categorical policy decision at the national level, the field officer's role was purely mechanical. Justice Cullen held that because no individual discretion survived at the field level, there was nothing left to fetter, a conclusion upheld on appeal: David Hunt FC at paras 33-37, aff'd David Hunt FCA at paras 3-7.

[116] In Jerram, the exercise of the same statutory power was upheld for the opposite reason: Justice Noël found that the regional inspector had residual discretion and genuinely exercised it. Specifically, the inspector "personally ascertained the circumstances of the subject bull," and then, during cross-examination, "referred to the decision... as his own" and "confirmed his conviction that the bull had to be destroyed": Jerram at para 35. Justice Noël emphasized that while the national policy strongly favoured destruction, it did not compel that outcome in every case. Therefore, what proved determinative was that the inspector's suspicion was genuinely formed and supported by evidence specific to the individual animal in question: Jerram at paras 42-52.

[117] These animal disease-control cases yield two foundational principles for analyzing fettering in multi-step administrative processes guided by a policy instrument. First, discretion must be understood as a unified whole across the entire process. Whether discretion of the overall process is fettered cannot be judged by looking at individual decision points in isolation. It must instead be assessed holistically, considering whether, when aggregated across the process, the appropriate overall level of discretion is preserved. Second, varying levels of discretion at different stages are permissible, provided that the process preserves the proportional discretionary authority mandated by statute. This framework explains why the outcomes in the David Hunt cases and Jerram align despite differing levels of in-field discretion. In the former, discretion was concentrated at earlier, ministerial stages, leaving implementation largely mechanical. For the latter, the policy left field-level officials with some meaningful discretionary power to assess the situation before them. Neither caused fettering because the decision-makers in each case properly exercised the discretion allocated to them within the respective policy frameworks.

[118] To summarize, when reviewing fettering claims in multi-phase administrative processes, courts should make two key considerations:

1) Evaluate the architecture of the entire administrative process to determine whether it as a whole preserves sufficient discretion for case-specific judgment or unlawfully diminishes discretion. This is a qualitative assessment of whether the overall process maintains discretionary power proportionate to what is granted by the statute or improperly removes or abandons discretion; and
2) Examine the specific decision-making step under review to determine how much discretion, if any, was left to the decision-maker at that step, and whether the individual properly exercised that discretion. This is the more traditional fettering inquiry, centered on whether the decision-maker treated non-binding soft law as legally binding.

## C. The law on legitimate expectation

[119] The doctrine of legitimate expectation is a core part of the procedural fairness principle. If an applicant has a legitimate expectation that a certain procedure will be followed, this procedure will be required by the duty of fairness: Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para 26; Agraira v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 [Agraira] at paras 94-95.

[120] To establish a legitimate expectation, applicants must demonstrate that the relevant public authority has made clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representations about the procedure it will follow, or have consistently adhered to certain procedural practices in the past: Canada (Attorney General) v Mavi, 2011 SCC 30 [Mavi] at para 68. Moreover, the representations must be within the authority's power to make, and applicants must have reasonably relied on the representations: Agraira at para 94.

[121] Applicants are entitled to rely on the administrative body's established procedures and publicly available policies, even if they are in general not legally binding. A failure by the decision-maker to follow its own procedures, or a unilateral departure from established practices without notice, may constitute a breach of procedural fairness: Tafreshi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 1089 at para 18; Kandiah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1096 [Kandiah] at paras 25-27.

[122] When an administrative body changes or deviates from its procedures in a way that affects applicants, procedural fairness may require that affected individuals be given notice of the changes and an opportunity to adjust or comply with the new procedures, especially if the changes or deviations could have significant or "fatal" consequences: Kandiah at paras 26-27; Popova v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 326 at para 11.

[123] However, the law is clear that the doctrine of legitimate expectation creates only procedural rights, not substantive ones: Agraira at para 97; Chelsea (Municipality) v Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 89 at para 36. Even if an individual had "a legitimate expectation that a particular outcome will be reached, that expectation is not enforceable": Canada (National Revenue) v JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc, 2013 FCA 250 [JP Morgan] at para 75; Jennings-Clyde, Inc. (Vivatas, Inc.) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FC 1141 [Jennings-Clyde] at para 40.

# VIII. Analysis

## A. Evidentiary issues: expert reports, affidavit, and Report of Inspector

### (1) There is No Need to Rule on the Admissibility and Weight of the Expert Reports

[124] I do not need to rule on the admissibility or weight of the challenged portions of the parties' expert reports, as the issues in this judicial review do not require weighing the scientific or technical insights they offer to properly conduct the reasonableness analysis. In fact, since the parties have marshalled their expert reports specifically to attack or defend the merits of the Stamping-Out Policy, examining and weighing these reports would lead to assessment of the Policy's merits. As described in the Legal Framework section, courts at all levels have consistently held that the merits of policy decisions are strictly off limits in a reasonableness review: Entertainment Software; South Shore; Kohl; Auer.

[125] The parties, especially the Applicant, have staked much of their respective cases on competing visions of the science and practice of avian-influenza control, and each vision is carried almost entirely through expert opinion. The Applicant's expert suite consists of three individuals drawn from outside of public service. Collectively, their reports are deployed by the Applicant attempting to show that the measures offered by the Stamping-Out Policy are neither scientifically supported nor the least-intrusive means available and, therefore, unreasonable in law.

[126] I summarize below in very broad strokes the key opinions offered in the expert reports submitted by both sides.

[127] Dr. Steven Pelech, a UBC professor and biochemist with years of training and experience in immunology and virology, supplies in his two reports the central thesis that the H5N1 detected at the Applicant's farm behaved phenotypically like a low-pathogenic strain. He cites as evidence the low mortality of adult birds, short-lived viral shedding, and the flock's likely attainment of immunity to the virus by mid-January. Dr. Pelech's conclusion goes to the heart of the Applicant's claim that CFIA's response failed to consider the disproportionality of implementing the Stamping-Out Policy on its premises as well as the lack of consideration of monitoring and further research, and therefore is unreasonable.

[128] Dr. Byram Bridle, an immunologist at the University of Guelph with research focused on virology, also furnishes microbiology and immunology opinions. He argues that detecting an H5 gene by RRT-PCR is not, without full pathotyping, proof of a highly pathogenic virus. Faced with a novel genotype, he opines, CFIA should first have performed a fresh risk assessment and considered vaccination or natural-immunity studies.

[129] Dr. Jeff Wilson, a current director of a veterinary science and infectious disease management consulting firm and former senior epidemiologist and manager at the Public Health Agency of Canada, overlays Dr. Pelech and Dr. Birdle's microbiology and immunology opinions with his epidemiological knowledge. Ostriches, Dr. Wilson says, live longer, range farther, and populate at far lower densities than conventional poultry, so close surveillance and targeted culling would have met international obligations with less collateral loss. Dr. Wilson further frames CFIA actions in adopting and implementing the Stamping-Out Policy as a policy failure when benchmarked against proper pandemic-response principles.

[130] The Respondent's scientific foundation rests on a single report by Dr. Shannon French, a CFIA veterinary epidemiologist who completed her doctorate research on the wildlife disease ecology of parasites and received various post-graduate trainings on epidemiology, virology, and poultry health management. Dr. French traces the full-genome sequencing that identified the virus on the Applicant's premises as a new HPAI H5N1 lineage, reviews international outbreak data illustrating silent but intense viral shedding in ratites, and explains why neither vaccination nor a "burn-out" strategy has gained WOAH endorsement for commercial poultry.

[131] Unsurprisingly, each side seeks to narrow the evidentiary footprint of the other, and asks this Court to rely on the opinion of their experts should opinions diverge. For the Respondent's expert report, the Applicant takes issue with Dr. French's impartiality, arguing that she joined CFIA as a doctoral student in 2020, and claiming her report strays into advocacy by endorsing the very policy under review. They also attempt to undermine the accuracy and credibility of her opinion on the characterization of the virus found on the Applicant's premises as an HPAI by pointing to her lack of specialized qualifications and experience focused on virology or immunology. The Applicant's counsel has not pinpointed any specific portions or paragraphs of Dr. French's affidavit that they ask to be struck or given no weight.

[132] For its part, the Respondent launches a two-pronged counterattack. It moves to strike 24 different portions of the Pelech, Wilson, and Bridle reports on the grounds that: 1) none of the authors have ever worked with ostrich production under outbreak conditions; 2) they rely on post-decision data and speculative modelling rather than contemporaneous evidence; and 3) their "herd-immunity" thesis sits well outside mainstream peer-reviewed literature. The Respondent also underlines that Drs. Pelech and Bridle have been criticized by courts in other legal proceedings for advocacy masquerading as expertise and have had their reports rejected. Concurrently, the Respondent defends Dr. French's credibility by pointing to her systematic review of relevant peer-reviewed literature, her concessions where data are uncertain, and the fact that her conclusions line up with WOAH manuals and with the culling protocol upon HPAI outbreaks in ostriches in South Africa, where the Applicant's line of flock reportedly originated.

[133] As previewed in the beginning of this section, I do not need to resolve the parties' battle over the admissibility and weight of their expert material. The dispute they invite the Court to referee is, in substance, a contest over whose science on the virus in question is "better" and therefore whose preferred animal and public health policy is "wiser." To decide a winner in this contest will cause this Court to commit two cardinal sins in reasonableness review. First, it will prompt this Court to reach beyond the legitimate scope of reasonableness review of a broad policy decision. Second, it will effectively make this Court an academy of science and an arbiter of truth in immunology and animal and public health.

[134] To reiterate, under Vavilov, this Court's task on this judicial review is to decide whether the Stamping-Out Policy, when read considering its enabling statute, falls within a range of outcomes that can be said to be rational, intelligible and justified. As the Federal Court of Appeal explained in Entertainment Software, decisions "very much unconstrained" by tight statutory language or adjudicative methodology, namely policy decisions with broad public interest implications, are correspondingly "harder to set aside" because merits-based disagreement is not a ground for intervention. The Stamping-Out Policy under review is precisely of that character. Like the policy decisions examined in South Shore and Kohl, it is a preventative, nationwide disease-control measure adopted to proactively manage and eradicate a serious threat to animal and public health, as well as international trade. As Auer teaches us, for such decisions, the reviewing court asks whether the policy can plausibly be located within the text, purpose and architecture of the Act, not whether it represents the optimal balance of virological, economic, or public health considerations.

[135] The rivalling expert reports add fuel to precisely such an inadmissible balancing exercise. The Applicant's evidence says the Stamping-Out Policy is economically wasteful, scientifically unnecessary, and ineffective, especially when it comes to the less studied situation of ostriches. The Respondent's evidence says it has been effective, epidemiologically indispensable, and trade-critical. Accepting either view would require me to adjudicate the substantive merits of the policy and, as support, to resolve contested matters of viral pathogenicity, host biology, export-market tolerance of policy changes and the like, a task the case law forbids: Coldwater First Nation at 119; Inverhuron at 40.

[136] Nor is it necessary to parse the expert evidence for the limited purpose of checking whether the CFIA had some evidentiary foundation to support its suspicion of HPAI infection and implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy during this wave of HPAI outbreak, including in the Applicant's situation specifically. The record already contains unchallenged factual materials, such as the existence of positive RRT-PCR results, whole-genome sequencing report, and information on contemporaneous HPAI outbreaks, on which the reasonableness of the suspicion and continuation of the Policy can be assessed. Whether different scientists might have drawn different risk conclusions, and which assessment this Court might prefer, is irrelevant to the reasonableness review at hand.

[137] In short, the parties' expert reports, however scientifically accurate, provide opinions on scientific truth, the weighing of which lies with the specialized administrative bodies, which are better positioned to assess the comparative prudence, efficacy, or proportionality of animal disease-control measures of general applicability. These are questions of policy merit and have no role in the reasonableness analysis of administrative decisions. For that reason, I decline to rule on the admissibility of the expert reports and afford them no weight in my reasons.

### (2) Dr. Cathy Furness' Affidavit is Admissible as Factual Narrative

[138] I find Dr. Cathy Furness' affidavit, tendered by the Respondent, admissible. To the extent that her affidavit refers to scientific concepts, these statements provide factual context for understanding CFIA's regulatory decisions rather than offering scientific or technical conclusions that would require expert qualification. Additionally, I treat those statements as factual narrative explaining what the CFIA understands and considers in its decision-making, not as definitive statements of scientific truth. I therefore find no basis to exclude Dr. Furness' affidavit or disregard portions of it as impermissible expert evidence.

[139] Dr. Furness is the Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer of the CFIA. Her affidavit offers background on the CFIA's understanding of the current HPAI outbreak that began in November 2021, the HPAI H5N1 virus detected at the Applicant's premises, and Canada's international obligations to implement the Stamping-Out Policy upon detection of HPAI. It also explains how the Stamping-Out Policy facilitates a faster return to disease-free status according to relevant international treaty, protects Canada's export markets through negotiated trade agreements, and supports coordinated global efforts to reduce public health risks from this zoonotic disease. The affidavit further details the Agency's legal authority under the Act, the specific application of these policies to the UOF case including the denial of their exemption request, and the coordinated federal-provincial response framework between CFIA and British Columbia authorities.

[140] The Applicant's counsel first raised their objection to the admissibility of this affidavit at the hearing. They insist that Dr. Furness' affidavit is inadmissible because it contains statements that offer opinion on technical and scientific matters, but is never tendered as an expert report properly qualified under Rule 52.2 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106. However, they did not identify any specific paragraphs or portions of the affidavit they sought to have struck or disregarded.

[141] The Respondent's counsel objected to the Applicant's challenge, noting that the case management judge had directed the parties identify any admissibility objections in advance of the hearing. Respondent's counsel argued that raising the challenge for the first time at the hearing was contrary to that direction. Respondent's counsel also asked for the specific parts of Dr. Furness' affidavit which the Applicant's counsel had challenged, so that they could address it in their submission. I agreed with the Respondent at the hearing on the request for clarification and pressed the Applicant to identify the challenged portions. In response, Applicant's counsel stated: "it is quite obvious when you read [Dr. Furness'] report where she is offering virology or immunology opinions."

[142] I am of the view that the Applicant's evidentiary challenge here must fail, if not for the fact that it did not observe case management procedures, than for the fact that, contrary to what the Applicant's counsel claims, Dr. Furness' affidavit does not obviously contain the type of statement that veers into expert evidence on virology and immunology.

[143] Having carefully reviewed Dr. Furness' affidavit in detail, I find this characterization inaccurate. The statements contained therein predominantly consist of facts that one would expect a Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer to possess through her official position, responsibilities, and direct involvement in Canada's HPAI response. Jurisprudence is clear that such information does not constitute "expert information, since it was not the kind of information that could only be acquired and understood with special training or expertise," but rather information gained through knowledge, observation, and experience in the ordinary course of one's position: R. v Millard, 2023 ONCA 426 at para 108; R. v Hamilton, 2011 ONCA 399 at para 277.

[144] For example, when Dr. Furness describes avian influenza variants being categorized into HPAI and LPAI strains or identifies which subtypes are listed in the Reportable Diseases Regulations, SOR/91-2, she is stating factual information learned from her responsibilities, not offering specialized scientific opinions that require specialized training. Similarly, when describing the current outbreak timeline, detection of specific virus subtypes, or international standards for response, Dr. Furness is stating facts directly accessible in her role. Her statements about the absence of effective treatments for HPAI in birds represent factual declarations about available options within CFIA's policy framework, not scientific opinions on treatment efficacy. These are matters that would reasonably be known to anyone in her position without requiring special expertise beyond what is necessary for her role. It is particularly telling that, when making these statements, she cites and attaches supporting documentation as exhibits, which include fact sheets and publications from authorities such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization. In other words, Dr. Furness is recounting and relaying information from these established sources, rather than communicating her opinions on scientific matters.

[145] The remaining portions of Dr. Furness' affidavit similarly consist of factual statements, such as descriptions of relevant WOAH standards, CFIA internal processes, and federal-provincial coordination frameworks, all of which fall within the realm of factual narrative. Her account of the Stamping-Out Policy's requirements and the consequences for disease-free status restates international standards that guide the CFIA's work. Her descriptions of the CFIA's emergency response framework, hazard-specific plans, and operational procedures reflect institutional knowledge directly linked to her official role. When detailing the coordinated response with British Columbia authorities, including the liaison officer structure, weekly meetings, and information-sharing protocols, Dr. Furness provides facts about administrative arrangements known to her through ordinary professional experience, not through specialized scientific training and expertise. These are precisely the kinds of statements expected from a senior public official addressing matters within her regulatory and operational mandate, not scientific opinions based on specialized training and expertise.

### (3) The Respondent's Report of the CFIA Inspector is Admissible Under the Business Record Exception

[146] The last piece of evidentiary dispute I must address before turning to the substance of the reasonableness analysis is whether the one-page "Inspection Report" dated January 31, 2025, and tendered as Exhibit O to the affidavit of Dr. Cathy Furness, may be received as evidence of what occurred during CFIA Inspector Dykstra's onsite visit of and the testing done at the Applicant's premises on December 30, 2024. I find that it is, based on the business record exception provided by section 30 of the Canada Evidence Act, RSC 1985, c C-5 [the CEA].

[147] The Inspection Report is a formal summary of the site visit of the Applicant's premises conducted by Inspector Dykstra, with particular focus on the availability of carcasses for sampling and the applicable biosecurity measure. The Report shows that Inspector Dykstra explained that "he would like to swab up to ten mortalities," but the Applicant's principal who accompanied him "stated there were only two mortalities in good enough condition to be sampled" since "the remaining mortalities had either been scavenged on by wild animals or were in later stages of decomposition." The Applicant contests this account, alleging that Inspector Dykstra refused additional carcasses despite being offered more. Based on this alternative version of events, the Applicant argues that the CFIA failed to comply with section 4 of the 2022 ERP, which requires sampling of all available dead birds up to ten at maximum, and therefore lacked a sufficient factual foundation for reasonably issuing the Notice to Dispose.

[148] The Applicant submits that the Report of Inspector should be struck as inadmissible hearsay that falls outside of the business record exception, applying evaluative frameworks in Ares v Venner, [1970] SCR 608 [Ares] and Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v Teva Canada Limited, 2017 FC 88 [Eli Lilly]. The Applicant advances three main arguments in support of this position. First, the Report lacks contemporaneity, as it was signed a month after the site visit without explanation for the delay. Second, the way the Report is tendered does not satisfy the personal knowledge element, since Inspector Dykstra did not provide direct evidence about the circumstances surrounding its creation. Third, the Report lacks independence, asserting that it was prepared "in contemplation of litigation," given that the CFIA had been notified of the Applicant's intention to seek judicial review of the Notice to Dispose shortly before the Report was finalized.

[149] The Applicant's objections rest on a misunderstanding of the law and a failure to read the Report of Inspector in conjunction with other similar reports furnished by the Respondent. The legal error concerns the requirement for personal knowledge. The Applicant's counsel specifically emphasized during the hearing that "we have no evidence from... Dykstra... the inspector, as to how and why he created the record a month later, the circumstances surrounding his creation of it." This submission misstates what is required to satisfy the personal knowledge requirement. The correct inquiry is whether the author of the document, in this case Inspector Dykstra, had personal knowledge of the matters being recorded, not whether the document must be tendered and supported by a direct attestation from that author personally.

[150] As the Supreme Court held in Ares, the reliability of business records arises from the circumstances of their creation, not the presence of the author:

Hospital records, including nurses' notes, made contemporaneously by someone having a personal knowledge of the matters then being recorded and under a duty to make the entry or record should be received in evidence as prima facie proof of the facts stated therein.

[151] The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the notion that the author's testimony is required to validate such records, pointing to the impracticality of demanding testimony from specific individuals in large organizations where "clerks and servants are changed from time to time, whose evidence may be difficult and often impossible to obtain": Ares at p 619, citing Ashdown Hardware Co. v Singer et al (1951), 3 WWR (NS) 145 (AD CA). This understanding of the personal knowledge element has not been modified by this Court in Eli Lilly, nor by the Federal Court of Appeal on appeal: Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v Teva Canada Limited, 2018 FCA 53. Accordingly, the relevant inquiry here is whether the author of the record, Inspector Dykstra, had firsthand knowledge of the events recorded. Whether he provided a direct attestation about the context in which the report was created is irrelevant. That function was properly fulfilled by Dr. Furness, who has explained in her affidavit about how the preparation of such reports are done in the ordinary course of business at the CFIA.

[152] The business record exception exists because institutional safeguards enhance reliability. The Applicant's insistence on requiring direct evidence from Inspector Dykstra misapprehends this underlying rationale of the exception. It is neither practical nor necessary to call every author of a record when institutional practices ensure its trustworthiness. In a national agency like the CFIA, where frontline officers like Inspector Dykstra routinely document field

I. Overview
[1] The Applicant, Universal Ostrich Farms Inc., challenges two related decisions made by the Respondent, Canadian Food Inspection Agency [the CFIA or the Agency], under section 48 of the Health of Animals Act, SC 1990, c 21 [the Act]. The first decision, a Notice to Dispose issued on December 31, 2024, ordered the destruction of all ostriches on the farm after laboratory tests confirmed infection with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI]. The second, an Exemption Denial, dated January 10, 2025, refused the farm's request to spare the flock on the basis that the ostriches formed a self-contained, unexposed "distinct epidemiological unit" with "rare and valuable poultry genetics," thus qualifying for an exemption from the Notice to Dispose under the CFIA's Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza 2022 Event Response Plan [the 2022 ERP].

[2] At the heart of this proceeding lies an inevitable tension between the CFIA's mandate to protect public health and the Applicant's wish to preserve its ostriches. Parliament has charged the CFIA with preventing the spread of designated zoonotic and enzootic diseases and with protecting the food supply, public health, and Canada's reputation in global trade. To do so, the Agency complies with the internationally recognized and applied "Stamping-Out Policy" approach recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health [WOAH] that requires rapid culling of affected avian populations. Conversely, the Applicant faces the loss of decades of selective breeding work, disruption to valuable commercial and scientific research, and destruction of birds that might no longer pose an active, ongoing risk of transmitting HPAI. Against this backdrop, the Applicant contends that the CFIA has, in issuing the Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial, disregarded its unique circumstances and fallen short of providing basic procedural fairness.
[3] These two applications address whether the CFIA's decisions were reasonable and procedurally fair based on facts available to the Agency at the time. This is not an appeal. The Court is not stepping into the shoes of the Agency and making the decisions that the Court feels ought to have been made. Instead, the focus of the review is on the Agency's reasoning and process.
[4] I dismiss both applications for judicial review. The Agency's decisions were reasonable based on the record before the decision-maker and were made in a procedurally fair manner.
[5] Courts must respect Parliament's choice to assign decision-making power to administrative bodies. This respect comes from the principle of separation of powers, a

cornerstone of Canadian public law: Wilson v Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, 2015 FCA 17 at para 30. The separation of powers compels courts to respect the legislature's choice to assign decision-making power to specialized administrative bodies, such as the CFIA, rather than to the judiciary: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] at para 30 .
[6] Courts must also respect the demonstrated scientific and technical expertise of administrative agencies. In administrative law, courts generally stay out of scientific debates and focus on whether the decision-makers used their expertise to make reasonable and procedurally fair decisions. When Parliament leaves technical or scientific assessments to specialized administrative bodies, it signals that those bodies, not the courts, are best positioned to make judgments on complex, expertise-driven matters. Indeed, Canadian administrative law explicitly warns that courts must not resolve scientific disputes or substitute their own views for those of specialized decision-makers authorized by Parliament to handle such issues: Vavilov at para 93. Judges are experts in law, not in public health, virology, epidemiology, or veterinary medicine. This case undeniably has a strong technical flavour. Both parties have submitted expert affidavits supported by scientific literature. The role of this Court is not to conduct afresh its own studies of that material and decide which science is correct, but to determine whether the CFIA's decisions were reasonable and procedurally fair based on the record before it.
[7] Judicial review hinges on what was before the decision-maker. With very few exceptions, reviewing courts on judicial review must mentally travel back to the moment when the decision was made, and judge the decision with only the evidence that was before the decision-maker at that moment. Here, the dates are December 31, 2024 for the Notice to Dispose

and January 10, 2025 for the Exemption Denial. A reviewing court must assess administrative decisions based exclusively on the information available to the decision-makers at the time they made those decisions: Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 FCA 22 at para 19; Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v Alberta Teachers' Association, 2011 SCC 61 at paras 22-26.
[8] If courts conducted judicial review with information that did not exist at the time of decision-making, they would be faulting decision-makers for lacking a crystal ball. No one has the gift of foresight, so courts must avoid reviewing decisions through the lens of hindsight. Therefore, this Court cannot consider "new" evidence, such as the current health status of the ostriches, recent test results, or updated scientific developments that become available only after January 10, 2025, the date of the Agency's last decision.
[9] Concepts like "reasonableness" and "procedural fairness" have specific meanings in administrative law, defined and refined over years of jurisprudence. Reasonableness asks whether the CFIA's explanation of its decisions tells a compelling story of how it reached them. Whether the story is compelling enough depends on whether the outcome and reasons are logically supported by the evidence on record, consistent with applicable law, and aligned with the Agency's past practices and own policies. Reasonableness does not ask whether the outcome is the best or most persuasive course of action.
[10] Procedural fairness is about the decision-making process itself, not the outcome. This assessment asks questions such as whether the Applicant received timely notice, whether the Applicant had meaningful chance to be heard, and whether the CFIA followed the procedures

that it promised it would. In this context, fairness is not about whether the substantive outcome feels fair in an everyday understanding, but whether the CFIA adhered to the required legal standards of fairness in the process it followed to reach its decisions. Keeping these legal meanings in mind helps avoid the understandable, but legally misplaced, reaction of equating "harsh outcome" with "unfair decision."
[11] This Court accepts that there is a real and negative impact of the CFIA's two decisions on the Applicant and its principals. Beyond the economic loss, the destruction of a long-established ostrich population is also a source of emotional distress, particularly given the decades of work and investment the principals have dedicated to breeding and raising their flock. I have considerable sympathy for them.
[12] Nonetheless, such personal losses must be weighed against the broader public interest in protecting public health and maintaining trade stability. Avian influenza is a virus capable of causing serious harm to both animals and humans, with significant implications for Canada's poultry businesses and international trade status. To combat threats like this virus, Parliament has authorized the CFIA to act decisively making swift decisions with far-reaching consequences, often under conditions of scientific uncertainty. This is a challenging mandate.
II. Background
A. The parties
[13] The Applicant operates a privately owned ostrich farm and research business located approximately ten kilometres outside Edgewood, British Columbia. The 65-acre operation is primarily managed by two principals with ostrich husbandry and selective breeding experience

dating back to the mid-1990s. Over the years, the Applicant has diversified its business portfolio to encompass operations in selling breeding stock, raising birds for slaughter, processing limited amounts of meat, offering agri-tourism tours, and, in recent years, focusing on extracting immunoglobulin Y from ostrich eggs for use in human-virus diagnostics.
[14] The CFIA has the statutory authority granted by the Act and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, SC 1997, c 6. While commonly associated with the regulation of food safety and quality in Canada, the Agency's broader mandate includes preventing and controlling communicable diseases in animals and plants that threaten public health, environmental integrity, or Canada's economic interests, including international trade in livestock and animal products. In furtherance of this mandate, the CFIA administers the 2022 ERP, which is the latest formalization and operationalization of the Stamping-Out Policy. The Agency reports to the Minister of Health, except where the Act assigns powers, duties, or functions to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food for matters unrelated to food safety.
B. The avian influenza virus
[15] Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is caused by influenza A viruses. Like all viruses, avian influenza viruses cannot replicate on their own and must infect hosts to do so. Their usual hosts are wild birds. Migratory waterfowl, particularly wild ducks, serve as natural hosts, potentially returning from their overwintering grounds each year with new viral variants. These viruses can also occasionally spread to domestic birds and, more rarely and sporadically, to mammals like humans.

[16] For domestic birds, transmission of the virus can occur through direct contact with infected wild or domestic birds, as well as through indirect exposure to contaminated environments. The ability of avian influenza to persist in the environment contributes to its transmission. It can persist outside of hosts in feces, grass, and soil. It can remain viable for months or even years in fresh water at low temperatures, creating long-lasting sources of infection or re-infection. On small holding operations like the Applicant's ostrich farm, common risk factors for transmission include direct contact between domestic and wild birds, proximity to environments such as wetlands, ponds, swamps, lakes, rivers, and grain fields, and the acquisition of birds with unknown health status.
[17] Human infection with avian influenza is rare but potentially deadly. Infection typically occurs through close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments, particularly where appropriate personal protective equipment and hygiene measures are lacking. Some strains of the virus are particularly lethal. For instance, approximately half of the more than 900 reported cases of human H5N1 infection worldwide since 1997 have resulted in death.
[18] Each strain of the avian influenza is identified by two special proteins on its surface: hemagglutinin, designated "H," and neuraminidase, designated "N." Hemagglutinin helps the virus bind to and enter host cells, while neuraminidase enables release and propagation of the virus from the host cells. The combination of H and N proteins plays a large role in deciding which specific animals the virus can infect, how easily it spreads, and how the host immune system recognizes and reacts to it. To date, sixteen hemagglutinin subtypes, H1-H16, and nine neuraminidase subtypes, N1-N9, have been documented in birds, producing the familiar binomial viral strain names such as "H5N1" or "H7N9."

[19] However, knowing the H and N subtypes of an avian influenza strain alone does not sufficiently reveal how harmful it is for birds. The avian influenza ability to cause serious disease, or its "pathogenicity," strongly depends on a small section of the hemagglutinin protein called the "cleavage site." At this site, certain host enzymes must cut the hemagglutinin to activate the virus. Depending on the sequence of amino acids at the cleavage site, the virus may either spread systematically throughout the host's body and damage multiple organs, or stay limited to the lungs, kidneys, or gastrointestinal tract and cause less serious consequences. In other words, the level of pathogenicity of avian influenza in birds depends heavily on the molecular structure of its cleavage site, as revealed by the amino acid sequence there.
[20] To find out the pathogenicity of a particular strain of avian influenza, one performs pathotyping. This usually involves testing three things: the subtype of hemagglutinin, the subtype of neuraminidase, and the amino acid sequence at the cleavage site. To do this, the laboratory technique called real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RRTPCR] is used to detect the genes for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase and identify their subtypes, such as "H5" and "N1." To analyze the cleavage site, the part of the hemagglutinin gene containing the cleavage site is amplified and then sequenced to see whether it has the amino acid pattern linked to high or low pathogenicity avian influenza [LPAI].

# C. Avian influenza outbreaks in Canada 

[21] Canada first confronted a major HPAI outbreak in 2004 in British Columbia. In February of that year, an LPAI H7N3 virus was detected in the Fraser Valley region. By March, the virus had mutated into an HPAI, spreading rapidly across both commercial and non-commercial premises. To contain the virus, over 14 million birds were disposed of. Two human cases were

reported, both presenting with conjunctivitis and mild influenza-like symptoms. Both individuals recovered fully. The outbreak was declared over by June 2004.
[22] Several smaller HPAI events occurred between 2004 and the current outbreak. The most significant occurred in 2015, when North America faced widespread outbreaks of H5N2 and H5N8 HPAI strains. In Canada, the impact was concentrated primarily in commercial poultry flocks in Ontario.
[23] The current nationwide HPAI outbreak began in November 2021 and has affected every province except Prince Edward Island. The outbreak started with detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 in wild bird populations in Canada before spreading to domestic poultry. Since then, HPAI has been confirmed on 527 domestic premises across the country, with British Columbia reporting the highest number of cases and some premises experiencing repeated infections. The outbreak has affected operations ranging from small backyard flocks to large scale commercial farms. Canada also recorded its first domestically acquired human case in late 2024, when a British Columbia teenager became critically ill and required intensive care. The individual has since made a full recovery.
III. Facts
A. The Applicant's ostrich operation
[24] The Applicant's property features open-air enclosures with shared facilities and proximity to wildlife. The farm is arranged with fenced and cross-fenced areas intended to separate groups of ostriches for breeding and care, while also providing a degree of biosecurity. No roofed barns

segregate ostriches of different age groups. A large natural pond, routinely visited by wild ducks and other waterfowl, lies near the centre, in between two of the outdoor bird pens.
[25] The Applicant has developed what it considers a uniquely large strain of ostriches through selective breeding since the 1990s. The ostriches are allegedly selected for body size and favourable genetic traits, with surplus birds not meeting these standards being discarded or culled. Some ostriches currently on the farm trace back to early imports from Africa and remain part of the breeding stock.
[26] From approximately 2020 onward, the Applicant shifted its primary commercial focus to extracting and studying antibodies, notably immunoglobulin Y, from ostrich eggs. For the Applicant, these antibodies have lucrative commercial and research values, especially in the development of diagnostics or therapeutics relevant to human viruses, such as the COVID-19 causing virus of SARS-CoV-2. To advance this antibody-based venture, the Applicant has collaborated with both domestic and international partners, including scientific researchers and private sector entities. Despite this strategic shift, some level of ostrich sales, along with sales or planned sales of products derived from ostrich fat and eggshells, continued through to at least December 2024.
[27] By early December 2024, the farm reportedly housed about 450 ostriches, including older breeding stock and newly introduced birds.

# B. Infections, investigations, and CFIA interventions 

[28] In February 2020, the Applicant's ostriches experienced a significant illness, reportedly resulting in roughly ten deaths. Laboratory tests confirmed bacterial infections caused by Proteus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Although unsupported by laboratory findings, the farm's principals speculated in hindsight that avian influenza might have contributed to the illness. Most ostriches were said to have recovered within weeks, leading the principals to suspect survivors might have developed natural immunity to future outbreaks of HPAI.
[29] In early December 2024, a new outbreak of respiratory symptoms emerged shortly after wild duck exposure. The Applicant observed respiratory or "flu-like" symptoms among a subset of ostriches, reminiscent of the 2020 illness. According to the farm's principals, those symptoms appeared roughly one week after "300-500 ducks ... landed on the premises." By late December, mortalities began increasing, particularly among newer ostriches, prompting consultation with a local veterinarian. Approximately 25 to 30 ostriches died within a threeweek period.
[30] The CFIA intervened on December 28, 2024, following an anonymous report of multiple ostrich deaths at the Applicant's premises. The Agency promptly contacted the Applicant and imposed a verbal quarantine order on the premises, with formal documentation to follow. The next day, the Applicant requested that a CFIA veterinarian assess the flock for avian influenza. Four additional ostriches died that same day.

[31] On December 30, 2024, CFIA inspectors visited the premises, collected swab samples from two carcasses suitable for laboratory testing, noted wild-bird activity at the pond, and observed that staff and equipment were shared and moved freely among open pens. That same day, the CFIA sent the Applicant a Declaration of Infected Place pursuant to section 22 of the Act and a Requirement to Quarantine per section 91.4 of the Health of Animals Regulations, CRC, c 296. These orders imposed movement controls and established biosecurity measures aimed at containing the HPAI outbreak on the Applicant's premises by preventing access to infected birds, carcasses, and contaminated areas by wild birds, other animals, and people.
[32] On December 31, 2024, the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network laboratory in Abbotsford, British Columbia, reported positive test results for the H5 avian influenza subtype. On January 3, 2025, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg, Manitoba, confirmed through genome sequencing that the pathogen was a HPAI subtype, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, and noted the virus's cleavage-site motif with amino acids "PLREKRRKR/GLF" was "compatible with HPAI viruses that came to Canada via the Pacific's flyway."
[33] The CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose on December 31, 2024, immediately after receiving confirmation of a positive test result for H5 avian influenza. Just 41 minutes after obtaining the test result, the CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose as guided by the 2022 ERP and pursuant to subsection 48(3) of the Act. The CFIA set February 1, 2025, as the deadline for disposal of all affected birds and related materials.
[34] On January 2, 2025, the CFIA Case Officer assigned to the Applicant's case contacted its principals to introduce herself, provide an overview of the situation, and establish a line of

communication to guide them through the multi-step administrative process. Their first interaction was a phone call, during which the principals first raised their theory that the older ostriches may have developed herd immunity because of the unreported 2020 "flu-like" illness, and expressed interest in seeking an exemption from depopulation. The Case Officer explained the exemption application process, emphasized its time-sensitive and document-intensive nature, and highlighted the need to submit a formal "Distinct Unit Request" in a package that the Agency would provide.
[35] Later that same day, the Case Officer sent two follow-up emails. The first email [the Process Introduction Email] was provided three hours following the call. This introductory email included several important attachments: the Notice to Dispose, the Declaration of Infected Place, the Requirement to Quarantine, and a document titled What to Expect - Steps on How CFIA Will Work Through the Process on Your Farm. This last document explained that the entire administrative process of depopulation is "fluid" in that while it consists of well-defined discrete steps, these may overlap in practice. It also detailed the anticipated procedural steps, including discussions with the Case Officer, a lengthy Premises Investigation Questionnaire interview, biocontainment assessment, depopulation, disposal, cleaning and disinfection, and compensation.
[36] The second email [the Exemption Process Overview Email] detailing exemption requirements was sent four hours after the call. It outlined various requirements, including official guidance on exemptions for birds with "rare and valuable genetics," and reiterated that the process is "document heavy." It provided information on how to apply for an exemption from depopulation on this basis. The email reproduced relevant policy content regarding this

category of exemption and explained that the assessment is based on both the submission of a completed Distinct Unit Request Package, which was attached to the email, and supporting evidence demonstrating the genetic value of the birds.
[37] Open and frequent communication between the Applicant and CFIA continued after the initial intake process. Following January 2, 2025, communications included virtual meetings, phone calls, emails, and a further on-site inspection. These interactions facilitated discussion and assessment of several key issues, including ostrich immunity, the genetic distinctiveness of the flock, the potential to identify an epidemiologically unexposed subgroup, and the farm's biosecurity conditions.
[38] On January 3, 2025, CFIA officials held a virtual meeting with the Applicant's principals to assist them in completing the Premises Investigation Questionnaire and to gather more information about the property. During the meeting, the son of one principal reported observing a neighbour entering areas already designated as an Infected Place. The Case Officer reminded the Applicant's principals of the importance of managing public perception, noting that their neighbours continued to contact the Agency with concerns about mortality management. The Case Officer emphasized the situation's urgency throughout the meeting, stressing the need for the Applicant to promptly submit evidence supporting their claimed relationship with Kyoto University and the asserted special genetic characteristics of the flock.
[39] On January 7, 2025, CFIA inspectors conducted another site visit at the Applicant's premises, which revealed further concerns with the biosecurity conditions at the farm. Inspectors observed wild ducks following them into the quarantine zone and noted the presence of weasels

in the barns. More than 50 wild ducks were seen within one of the ostrich enclosures. Although the Applicant's principals had attempted to fence off a nearby pond, they explained that the wild ducks continued to access the ostrich feed dishes by flying in. The principals also sought guidance from the inspectors on completing the Distinct Unit Request Package. The inspectors reiterated the importance of submitting as much supporting evidence as possible to strengthen their exemption request.
[40] Between January 4 and 9, 2025, the Applicant submitted several documents to support its exemption application while ostrich deaths continued. The main document was the completed Distinct Unit Request Package. Other supporting documents included letters of support, and information detailing its business selling ostrich antibodies and other commercial ventures as support for the Applicant's claim that its ostriches should be exempted for their "rare and valuable genetics" worthy of preservation.
[41] On January 10, 2025, the CFIA issued the Exemption Denial. It concluded that the Applicant had failed to demonstrate the existence of any distinct epidemiological unit free from exposure risk. Additionally, the CFIA found that the Applicant had not submitted sufficient evidence to support its claims of genetic rarity and value qualifying the flock for an exemption.
[42] By mid-January 2025, the spread of illness had reportedly plateaued, although some ostriches remained ill or continued to die. CFIA officials continued to monitor the situation. By the end of January 2025, total ostrich mortalities tied to flu-like illness reportedly reached 69 birds. The Applicant alleges that the last death occurred on January 15, 2025, with the

surviving majority appearing healthy or recovered. This reinforced its belief in the flock's attainment of at least partial herd immunity against H5N1.
[43] Late in January 2025, the Applicant requested permission to conduct or arrange additional tests on apparently healthy ostriches to confirm whether they were shedding virus. The Applicant also sought to have recognized genetic experts examine the flock. The record indicates the CFIA did not approve further testing at that stage. It focused instead on the confirmed H5N1-positive test results and reiterated the infection risk associated with an open-air ostrich operation like that of the Applicant's.

# IV. Decisions Below 

[44] This judicial review arises from the CFIA's Notice to Dispose and its Exemption Denial. The Notice to Dispose mandates the destruction and disposal of the Applicant's ostriches, while the Exemption Denial refuses the Applicant's request that some or all the birds be spared. Together, these two decisions illustrate the CFIA's position that the Applicant's entire ostrich flock must be culled due to H5N1, with no exemption warranted. The underlying record includes not only the formal instruments themselves, but also supporting documentation such as meeting minutes, telephone call summaries, email correspondence, and internal memoranda. These materials together form the pertinent decision record before this Court.
[45] Before highlighting key aspects of the decision record, it is helpful to situate these decisions within the CFIA's broader administrative process that implements the disposal of animals and things contemplated by subsection 48(1) of the Act. The Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial are two steps in the multi-step process for containing and eradicating the

current wave of HPAI, as set out in the 2022 ERP, which operationalizes the Stamping-Out Policy pursuant to the statutory discretion provided by subsection 48(1). The Notice initiates destruction of affected flocks based on established epidemiological criteria. The Exemption Denial serves as a secondary review that evaluates whether specific circumstances justify departing from the primary disease-control protocol.

# A. Notice to Dispose 

[46] On December 31, 2024, the CFIA issued the Notice to Dispose requiring destruction of all poultry on the premises. This Agency did this through a Form 4202 Requirement to Dispose of Animals or Things, citing statutory authority under section 48 of the Act. This Order stated that "Avian Influenza" had been "determined or suspected" on the premises and required "all poultry and poultry carcasses along with other material approved by CFIA disposal crew" to be destroyed. The operative period ran from the date of the order to February 1, 2025. The Order treated ostriches as "poultry" for disease-control purposes. At this initial stage, the CFIA did not consider whether any portion of the flock might be exempted.
[47] On January 12, 2025, the CFIA issued an Amended Notice to Dispose, revoking and replacing the initial order of December 31, 2024, to correct several technical details without changing the ordered depopulation. This amendment corrected certain updated quarantine details, primarily the GPS coordinates, while leaving unchanged the substantive requirement to depopulate all ostriches and the original disposal timeline. The amended Order reaffirmed that ostriches fall under the classification of "poultry" for HPAI control purposes and reiterated that all listed animals and items remained subject to destruction. An accompanying explanatory note confirmed that the effective date of the original Notice to Dispose remained December 31, 2024.

[48] Immediately following the issuance of the original Notice to Dispose, the CFIA communicated with the Applicant providing further details regarding movement restrictions, quarantine measures, and the CFIA's avian influenza Stamping-Out Policy. While these additional communications did not add any new formal reasons, they clarified the administrative processes and reinforced the CFIA's position that full flock depopulation was mandatory unless an exemption was explicitly approved. On January 3, 2025, the CFIA Compensation Unit contacted the Applicant to provide information regarding compensation for the ordered destruction of the ostriches pursuant to Compensation for Destroyed Animals and Things Regulations, SOR/2000-233 [the Compensation Regulations].

# B. Exemption Denial 

[49] Following receipt of the Notice to Dispose, the Applicant sought exemption from depopulation claiming, first, that there is a distinct epidemiological unit within its flock that was either unexposed or at reduced risk and, second, that the flock contained "rare and valuable poultry genetics," which warranted preservation from complete depopulation. On January 10, 2025, the CFIA denied both exemption requests. Three sets of documents within the record are particularly significant in illustrating the CFIA's reasoning and decision-making process in evaluating and rejecting the Applicant's exemption request.
[50] The first set of documents consists of the Exemption Process Overview Email with the attached Distinct Unit Request Package, both dated January 2, 2025. This Email from the Case Officer and its attachment detailed the criteria for qualifying as a distinct epidemiological unit and listed the type of supporting documentation required for exemption under the "rare and valuable genetics" category. According to the Email, examples of acceptable documentation

included historical records of genetic investment, evidence that the flock consists of high-quality purebred birds, and proof of genomic testing for specific traits.
[51] These documents were sent shortly after the Case Officer's initial intake phone call with the Applicant's principals, during which the principals expressed interest in seeking an exemption. In the Exemption Process Overview Email, the Case Officer invited the Applicant to submit supporting documentation for the exemption request, characterizing the application process as "document heavy." The Email reads:

Hello Again,
Sorry for the multiple emails!
This process is document heavy, but I'm here to help you navigate the process!

Based on the information we've gathered, you fall into the "birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics" category. I've copied CFIA's description here:

Rare and valuable genetics in poultry refers to uncommon genetic lines of poultry that hold a high economic value. Genetic breeding of poultry involves the creation of multi-generation genetically diverse populations on which selection is practiced to create adapted animals with new combinations of specific desirable traits. It is this combination of an uncommon breed or line of poultry, which undergoes a selection process to create specific desirable traits which leads to its high economic value.

# 3.1 Initial screening to classify birds as having rare and valuable genetics 

The genetics of the flock can be demonstrated to be distinctive from standard commercial flocks with criteria such as but not limited to the following:

- There is historical evidence of genetic investment (e.g. breeding books, use of closed flocks of breeding pure line birds for a prolonged period, a selection program from trained geneticists is implemented);

- The flock consists of high quality pure-bred birds (e.g. are recognized by breed associations, 3rd party national/international organizations or by the poultry industry as top producers/prized genetics/suppliers of genetics);
- Genomics testing for specific traits has been undertaken

Here's what we need from you at this time to get started:

- We need documented proof that these birds are distinctive from standard commercial flocks. The highlighted section above gives good examples of the types of documents we're looking for.
- If you have any documentation of the agreement between you and the university - that'd be really helpful to send to us.
- I'll also need you guys to fill out the attached document Distinct Unit Package that will need to be completed and sent back to me.

Thanks,
[bold and italic in the original]
[52] The second set of documents comprises the Applicant's submissions supporting their exemption request. These documents, submitted to the CFIA Case Officer between January 2 and 10, 2025, included business plans highlighting research into ostrich antibodies, the potential commercialization of specific genetic lines, and assertions about the flock's unique African genetic heritage. They also contained diagrams illustrating the farm's physical layout, depicting fenced partitions and a large central natural pond, as well as letters from collaborators affirming the distinctiveness and commercial or research value of the flock.
[53] The third set of documents consists of the CFIA's formal communication of the denial and reasoning. This includes the Case Officer's January 10, 2025, email communicating the denial, the attached Response Letter providing formal reasons, and an Internal Recommendation

Memorandum that formalized internal decision-making discussions. The email acknowledged the emotional distress that the Applicant's principals may experience and offered follow-up discussion opportunities with CFIA officials. The attached Response Letter explained that ostriches are "poultry" under its existing policy and the WOAH definitions, that selective disposal of birds would conflict with Canada's Stamping-Out obligations, and that the evidence did not satisfy the distinct epidemiological unit exemption threshold and the criteria for the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption. It concluded: "This decision is final and is not subject to appeal" [emphasis in the original].
[54] Informing the Exemption Denial was the Internal Recommendation Memorandum prepared and reviewed by the Exemption Committee. This Memorandum forms part of the Exemption Denial decision, as administrative decision-makers are entitled to adopt the reasoning of recommending bodies, such as the Exemption Committee, with the adopted reasoning being treated as that of the decision-makers: Canada (Attorney General) v Sketchley, 2005 FCA 404 at para 37-39.
[55] The Exemption Committee reviewed the Applicant's submissions and the Agency's internal policies and concluded there was "no evidence of a subset of birds existing as a distinct unit or at a different level of risk." This finding was based on site visits and documentation confirming that the Applicant's ostriches roamed outdoors across multiple pens, shared feed and staff, and frequently interacted with wild birds attracted to the central pond. Given the open layout of the farm, the shared equipment and staff, and the uniform risk of H5N1 transmission, the Committee concluded it was impractical to subdivide the flock for biosafety purposes, finding no distinct epidemiological units that could qualify for exemption.

[56] The Committee also determined that the Applicant failed to show the genetic uniqueness or economic value of the flock. The Exemption Committee highlighted that the Applicant had "a significant burden of proof... to demonstrate the high economic value the flock provides to the broader Canadian poultry industry" and the nature of the "robust processes ... to actively select and breed for specific desirable traits." The Committee concluded that the Applicant had not met either requirement based on the evidence it had provided. Additionally, the Committee conducted an analysis on trade implications of non-adoption or non-implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy and wrote about a preliminary scientific literature review indicating that ostriches can harbour and spread sub-clinical H5N1 and potentially facilitate further viral mutations and reassortments.
[57] Collectively, these documents articulate this rationale: ostriches, classified as poultry under Canadian avian influenza control policies, must be destroyed pursuant to the WOAHsupported Stamping-Out Policy upon confirmation of HPAI infection unless strict exemption criteria are met. Based on this rationale, the CFIA determined the Applicant's flock was uniformly exposed to risk and concluded the Applicant failed to supply sufficient evidence to satisfy the exemption criteria.

# C. Injunction 

[58] The Applicant filed a motion to enjoin the CFIA from enforcing the Notice to Dispose and the Requirement to Quarantine. By Order dated January 31, 2025, this Court stayed the Notice to Dispose "until a decision is rendered in the underlying application for judicial review." The Requirement to Quarantine was left untouched.

V. Issues
[59] The Applicant identifies five issues in their written submissions:

1) The applicable standard of review;
2) Whether the CFIA properly exercised its discretion in issuing the Notice to Dispose;
3) Whether the CFIA breached procedural fairness in making the Exemption Denial;
4) Whether the CFIA properly applied its own exemption criteria; and
5) Whether the CFIA properly exercised its discretion in issuing the Exemption Denial.
[60] At the hearing, the Applicant raised two novel issues, both bearing on the reasonableness of the CFIA's implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy in the Applicant's specific circumstances. First, whether the CFIA relied on an incorrect factual assumption about the pathogenicity of the virus in deciding to apply the Policy. Second, whether the CFIA's classification of the farm's ostriches as "poultry" was incorrect and, if so, whether that misclassification rendered its application of the Policy unreasonable.
[61] The Respondent proposes a different three-part framing of the issues:
6) Should portions of the five expert reports filed by the Applicant be struck;
7) Was the Notice reasonable and issued in a procedurally fair manner; and
8) Was the Exemption Refusal reasonable and made in a procedurally fair manner.
[62] Although neither party's framing fully captures the scope and complexity of the issues in this judicial review, I find two submissions made by the Respondent's counsel at the hearing particularly helpful in structuring the analysis. First, the Respondent correctly points out that the

Applicant devotes significant attention to challenging the reasonableness of the Stamping-Out Policy itself. Hence, addressing the reasonableness of the Policy as a distinct issue yields a clearer and more logical analysis. Second, the Respondent's conceptual distinction between the formulation and implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy strikes at the heart of this case. Treating these as distinct parts to be analyzed, each subject to different contextual factors and judicial review considerations, provides a more coherent and analytically sound framework.
[63] Accordingly, this Court frames the issues as follows:

1. Whether the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy, as currently operationalized through the 2022 ERP policy document, is reasonable in law?
2. Whether the CFIA's implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy was reasonable and procedurally fair given the Applicant's specific circumstances?
2.1. Whether the Notice to Dispose was made through a fair process, unfettered, and reasonable?
2.2. Whether the Exemption Denial was made through a fair process and reasonable?
[64] Finally, this Court also needs to address several evidentiary objections raised by both parties. These include admissibility and weight to be afforded to portions of each other's expert reports, certain challenged parts of the affidavit of Dr. Cathy Furness submitted by the Respondent, and the challenge to the reliability of the Respondent's Report of Inspector, authored and signed by Inspector Dykstra on January 31, 2025.

VI. Standard of Review
A. The fundamentals
[65] The parties submit that the applicable standard for review of procedural fairness is correctness. However, based on the jurisprudence, I find a more accurate characterization to be one that resembles the correctness standard but shifts the focus from determining the correct procedure to assessing "whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances": Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 [Canadian Pacific] at para 54; Heiltsuk Horizon Maritime Services Ltd v Atlantic Towing Limited, 2021 FCA 26 at para 107. The goal of the procedural fairness review should always be investigating "the ultimate question [of] whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond": Canadian Pacific at para 56.
[66] For substantive review, I agree with the parties that the CFIA's decisions to issue the Notice to Dispose and Exemption Denial are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness, as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Vavilov.
[67] Reasonableness review is one single deferential yet robust standard: Vavilov at paras 12-13 and 89. The Court must give considerable deference to the decision-maker, recognizing that this entity is empowered by Parliament and equipped with specialized knowledge and understanding of the "purposes and practical realities of the relevant administrative regime" and "consequences and the operational impact of the decision" that the reviewing court may not be attentive towards: Vavilov at para 93. Judicial intervention is warranted only when the flaws or shortcomings are "sufficiently serious... such that [the

decision] cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency:" Vavilov at para 100. Absent exceptional circumstances, reviewing courts must not interfere with the decision maker's factual findings and cannot reweigh and reassess evidence considered by the decision-maker: Vavilov at para 125.
[68] However, reasonableness review is not a mere "rubber-stamping" process: Vavilov at para 13. It is the reviewing court's task to assess whether the decision as a whole is reasonable; that is, it is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision-maker: Vavilov at para 85.
[69] A court conducting reasonableness review is not, and must not become, an "academy of science": Coldwater First Nation v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 FCA 34 [Coldwater First Nation] at para 119; Inverhuron \& District Ratepayers Ass. v Canada (Minister of The Environment), 2001 FCA 203 [Inverhuron] at para 40. When conducting reasonableness review of decisions involving highly scientific and technical subject matters, courts must pay careful attention to the decision-maker's expertise: Vavilov at paras 92 and 93. This expertise warrants judicial deference in the assessment of facts: Vavilov at para 125; Safe Food Matters Inc. v Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 1471 [Safe Food Matters] at para 121; Dias v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 126 at para 8. Similarly, deference is also warranted in the interpretation of law, particularly when it pertains to the decision-maker's home statutes: Safe Food Matters at paras 8 and 111; Balogh v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 447 at para 18. However, such expertise must be demonstrated by the decision-makers for the judiciary to afford it deference: Vavilov at para 93; Mason v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 SCC 21 at para 70.

[70] In addition to considering the administrative decision-maker's demonstrated expertise, the relevant evidentiary record, and the applicable legal framework, reviewing courts must also pay attention to the impact of the decision on those affected by its consequences. This dimension of judicial scrutiny has been brought to the forefront of reasonableness review by the Supreme Court in paragraphs 133 to 135 of Vavilov: "concerns regarding arbitrariness will generally be more acute in cases where the consequences of the decision for the affected party are particularly severe or harsh, and a failure to grapple with such consequences may well be unreasonable."

# B. Reasonableness review of policy decisions 

[71] The context of administrative decisions shapes what constitutes reasonable decisionmaking, even though it does not alter the standard of review itself. As established in Vavilov at paragraph 89, although context does "not modulate the standard or the degree of scrutiny by the reviewing court," it does "constrain [...] what will be reasonable for an administrative decision maker to decide in a given case." This distinction means that while courts must apply consistent analytical rigour for judicial reviews of all administrative decisions, the outcomes of a reasonableness review will necessarily vary depending on the decision-making context, with "some decisions [being] more likely to survive reasonableness review because they are relatively unconstrained," while "other decisions may be less likely to survive because they are relatively more constrained": Entertainment Software Association v Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, 2020 FCA 100 [Entertainment Software] at para 25.
[72] Policy decisions fall into the "very much unconstrained" category and therefore are "harder to set aside": Entertainment Software at paras 24-28 and 31. They typically require

balancing of complex social, scientific, economic, and public interest considerations, which are better left for the executive branch of the government and its various administrative arms. This is particularly true for policy decisions establishing general frameworks "without reference to particular cases," as they are even less adjudicative and administrative in nature. Importantly, courts should not recast such decisions as administrative acts merely because certain actors may experience a sharper economic impact than others: South Shore Trading Co. Ltd. v Canada (Fisheries, Oceans and Coast Guard), 2025 FC 174 [South Shore] at paras 44-48.
[73] Historically, judicial intervention in policy decisions has been limited to specific, narrow grounds. Precedents such as Maple Lodge Farms v Government of Canada, [1982] 2 SCR 2 [Maple Lodge Farm], have established that courts may interfere only where the policy is tainted by bad faith, breaches an express requirement of statutory natural justice, or relies on considerations that are "irrelevant or extraneous" to the statute's purpose: South Shore at para 50, citing Maple Lodge Farms at pp 7-8.
[74] The Supreme Court of Canada has now folded these traditional grounds for intervention into Vavilov's unified reasonableness framework. In Auer v. Auer, 2024 SCC 36 [Auer], the Supreme Court established that subordinate legislation, such as regulations, is presumptively reviewed for reasonableness. The "irrelevant, extraneous or completely unrelated" test from Katz Group Canada Inc. v Ontario (Health and Long-Term Care), 2013 SCC 64, now functions merely as a reminder that subordinate rules must remain within the enabling statute's boundaries, rather than as a separate threshold distinct from Vavilov's framework: Auer at paras 29-36, 4147 and 50-65. At paragraphs 59 to 65 of Auer, the Supreme Court stressed that "the governing statutory scheme, other applicable statutory or common law and the principles of statutory

interpretation are particularly relevant constraints" under reasonableness review. The central question for reviewing courts is whether the impugned instrument can plausibly be located within the purpose, text, and overall architecture of the enabling statute. Weighing the substantive merits of policymaking is strictly off limits: Auer at paras 55-58.
[75] Although Auer addressed specifically decisions to make subordinate legislation, its reasoning logically extends to policymaking decisions. The key connective tissue is the source of authority: in both contexts, the decision-maker exercises broad, delegated discretionary power to pursue legislative objectives. Vavilov has identified the governing statute, other relevant law, and factual context as the "legal and factual constraints" on every administrative act: Vavilov at paras 105-135. Therefore, whether discretion manifests through formal regulations or through general policy directives, administrative decision-makers must always interpret their enabling provisions purposively, act within statutory boundaries, and demonstrate that their legislative or quasi-legislative actions advance the statutory objectives given the available legal and factual constraints.
[76] Consequently, the core reasonableness review considerations articulated in Auer should also apply to policymaking decisions. The analytical framework should not turn on the formal label of "regulation." What matters most is the nature of the decision itself. Specifically, whether it creates generally applicable rules on statutory authority to be applied by more frontline decision-makers in the administrative decision-making chain. This description encompasses ministerial directives, Cabinet guidelines, and disease-control policies no less than regulations. Accordingly, the analytical framework in Auer that includes the principles of presumption of validity, purposive interpretation, and prohibition on merits review should also

guide courts reviewing any policymaking decision. Ultimately, the inquiry remains whether the decision to adopt the policy instrument is grounded in a rational, purposive interpretation of the enabling statute and respects all relevant procedural, substantive, and contextual limits.
[77] Deference is particularly warranted for policy decisions intended to safeguard animal and public health from high-risk disease. Case law has shown this principle consistently. In Kohl v Canada (Department of Agriculture), [1995] FCJ No. 1076 (FCA) [Kohl], the Federal Court of Appeal described a ministerial order made under section 48 of the Act as a "policy decision obviously not subject to the requirements of the rules of natural justice or procedural fairness," reviewable solely for abuse or misuse of power: Kohl at para 18.
[78] The teaching from Kohl is clear. Where a policy decision ordering blanket disposal of affected animals and things is made in good faith, reviewing courts should confine their reasonableness analysis to whether the destruction advances the objectives of the Act and whether there is some evidence to support the underlying suspicion. Following Vavilov, the threshold for finding sufficient support today is undoubtedly reasonableness, meaning the question is whether the suspicion is reasonably supported by the evidence and consistent with applicable legal constraints. Substituting a different view of the scientific and operational determinations underlying the policy decision would risk treading on the executive's policy prerogative: Kohl at paras 20-22.
[79] Entertainment Software, South Shore, Kohl and Auer converge into a single guiding principle: courts serve as guardians of legality, not arbiters of the wisdom of policy. When the legislature explicitly delegates public interest decisions, such as the management of animal and

public health, to administrative actors, courts must leave assessment of policy merits, especially the nuanced balancing of scientific, economic, and social factors, to decision-makers tasked by Parliament with those responsibilities. Judicial review of policy decisions should only target compliance with legal and factual constraints, and verification of whether the alleged exercise of technical expertise in formulating the policy decisions has been sufficiently demonstrated.
VII. Legal Framework
A. The law and policy on disposal of affected or contaminated animals and things
(1) The Statutory and Regulatory Scheme
[80] Under the Act, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food [the Minister] holds significant powers to manage diseases in animals. These powers advance the Act's core objectives by proactively preventing and controlling animal diseases and reducing the risk of transmission to humans, thereby protecting public health and preserving Canada's international trade status: River Valley Poultry Farm Ltd v Canada (Attorney General), 2009 ONCA 326 [River Valley Poultry Farm] at para 68; Paradis Honey Ltd v Canada (Agriculture and Agri-Food), 2024 FC 1921 [Paradis Honey] at para 23; Jerram v Canada (Minister of Agriculture) (T.D.), [1994] 3 FC 17 [Jerram] at para 30; Kohl at paras 7-12.
[81] The Act provides multiple tools for containing disease outbreaks, including infected place declarations, quarantines, and control zones. The Minister and their delegates have authority to declare infected places under sections 22 to 23 , impose quarantines per section 25 , and establish primary control zones pursuant to section 27. These declarations trigger strict prohibitions against the movement of animals or related items within or out of affected areas without a licence to facilitate swift containment of potential outbreaks. Notably, Parliament has

anticipated the need for broad and proactive containment measures. As such, under subsection 22(2), control orders automatically extend not only to directly affected premises but also to adjacent lands, buildings, or properties owned or occupied by the same individual.
[82] Central to this judicial review is section 48 of the Act. Subsection 48(1) empowers the Minister and their delegates to order the destruction of animals or things in three scenarios: (a) if the animal is infected, suspected of infection, or contaminated by a disease or toxic substance; (b) if the animal has been in contact with or in proximity to an infected animal or thing; or (c) if the animal itself is a vector, causative agent, or toxic substance. Enforcement is governed by subsection 48(3), which mandates a written "Notice to Dispose" specifying the timeline and method of destruction. Compliance is compulsory, as failure to act permits authorities to directly dispose of the animals. Subsection 48(2) offers an alternative to destruction, allowing treatment instead, but only where the Minister is satisfied that treatment will "eliminate or prevent the spread" of the disease or toxic substance.
[83] Parliament has clearly conferred broad discretion on the Minister and their delegates under section 48 of the Act. The Federal Court of Appeal has confirmed that even a mere suspicion of exposure, without confirmed contamination, is sufficient to justify issuing a Notice to Dispose under the Act: Kohl at para 20. This broad latitude is also reflected in Parliament's use of the permissive language "may." However, this discretion is limited to a functional binary of destruction and treatment. Within this framework, the discretion focuses on two key decisions: (1) whether to order destruction or authorize treatment; and (2) how to carry out the chosen course of action. The statute leaves no room for a third "wait-and-see" approach. Interpreting section 48 to allow for such an option would violate the "well established principle

of statutory interpretation that the legislature does not intend to produce absurd consequences," which include situations where an interpretation "is incompatible with other provisions or with the object of the legislative enactment": Rizzo \& Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), [1998] 1 SCR 27 at para 27. Given the Act's objectives of proactive disease prevention and control, a "wait-and-see" approach, unless it can be reasonably nested under a destruction or treatment plan, would undermine those core mandates and result in precisely the kind of incompatible interpretation the law forbids.
[84] Moreover, discretion under the treatment option is narrowly circumscribed by scientific and operational realities. Subsection 48(2) explicitly limits treatment to situations "where the Minister considers that the treatment will be effective in eliminating or preventing" the spread of disease. This means that the Minister and their delegates' discretion to authorize treatment is therefore limited by scientific and operational realities: they must have confidence that treatment is both scientifically viable and practically feasible. Consequently, where the Minister and their delegates determine that treatment provided by subsection 48(2) of the Act cannot reliably eradicate or prevent the spread of a high-risk disease, the Act effectively compels the ordering of destruction contemplated by subsection 48(1).
[85] Recognizing that the CFIA's mandate is protective rather than punitive, the Act also balances depopulation requirements with compensation to affected animal owners. Specifically, under subsection 51(1) of the Act, owners whose animals are destroyed or die after being required to be destroyed are entitled to compensation calculated based on the animal's market value prior to destruction, less any residual value in the carcasses. Nevertheless, this market valuation is subject to regulatory caps provided by the Compensation Regulations. Specifically,

pursuant to subsection 2(a) and the associated Schedule, compensation for an ostrich is limited to a maximum of $\$ 3,000$ per animal. The compensation framework also extends beyond the value of the animals themselves. Subsection 51(4) of the Act permits additional compensation for disposal-related costs, which, as specified by subsection 3(1) of the Compensation Regulations, may include reasonable costs of transportation, slaughter, cleaning and disinfection, disposal services, and personal labour expended by the owner.
[86] Importantly, this compensation scheme is no-fault in nature and tied to compliance with CFIA directives. Compensation becomes payable after destruction pursuant to section 48 of the Act. In this way, the framework encourages timely cooperation with the Agency's disease control measures while recognizing the significant economic impact borne by owners whose flocks must be sacrificed in the interest of protecting the broader public good.
(2) The Jurisprudence on the Act's Objective and the Decision-Maker's Discretion
[87] This Court has long recognized that, when faced with urgent threats to animal health, public safety, or economic interests, the Minister and their delegates are entitled to adopt drastic measures that may seriously and adversely impact individuals affected by the decision, particularly in economic terms. As Justice Cullen recognized in David Hunt Farms Ltd v Canada (Minister of Agriculture), 1994 CarswellNat 1859 (FC TD) [David Hunt FC] at para 51, the authorities may legitimately pursue an "admittedly draconian approach," provided it is pursued in good faith and for legitimate public-interest objectives. In such circumstances, the broader public interest in disease-control prevails over individual property rights, especially given the statutory compensation mechanisms available under section 51 of the Act: David Hunt $F C$ at para 52 .

[88] The jurisprudence further makes clear that the Minister's discretion under subsection 48(1) includes the power to develop general policy directives, the implementation of which is delegated to subordinate officials: David Hunt FC at para 43, aff'd David Hunt Farms Ltd v Canada (Minister of Agriculture), 1994 CarswellNat 1876 (FCA) [David Hunt FCA] at paras 4-5, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused [1994] SCCA No. 353; Carpenter Fishing Corp. v. Canada, [1997] FCJ No 1811 (FCA) [Carpenter Fishing] at paras 28-29. This principle reflects the recognized distinction between two types of discretion under the Act: a broad discretion involving the formulation of general policy, and a constrained discretion exercised by officials responsible for implementing that policy.
[89] This distinction gives rise to a two-phase framework for understanding the exercise of discretion under subsection 48(1). In the first phase, at the ministerial level, the Minister exercises broad discretion to formulate general policies governing the control of animal diseases. As Justice Cullen noted in paragraph 43 of David Hunt FC, "section 48(1) vests the discretion to require the disposal of animals in the Minister, not in a person such as an inspector, or a District Veterinarian." In the second phase, at the administrative level, frontline officials implement the policies established by the Minister, typically exercising little to no independent discretion. This division mirrors the approach identified by the Federal Court of Appeal in Carpenter Fishing at paragraph 28, where the Court explicitly distinguished between "the imposition of a quota policy" as "a discretionary decision in the nature of policy or legislative action" and "the granting of a specific license" as an administrative action.
[90] This two-phase structure aligns with established administrative law principles and ensures operational feasibility. The structure conforms with principles distinguishing between

the more permissible delegation of administrative tasks and the more problematic delegation of quasi-legislative or judicial functions: The Queen v Harrison, [1977] 1 SCR 238 at p 245; Re Peralta and the Queen, [1985] OJ No 2304 at paras 63-73; The Dene Nation v The Queen, [1984] 2 FC 942 at p 947. Practically, requiring the Minister to personally make every decision concerning animal health across the country would be unworkable and inconsistent with the need for an efficient and effective animal disease response system. By allowing the Minister and their delegates to set general policy and entrust its routine implementation to officials, the two-phased statutory scheme promotes operational feasibility and consistency in a large tribunal like the Agency, which exercises discretionary powers with significant consequences for Canadians: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Thamotharem, 2007 FCA 198 [Thamotharem] at para 60. As the case law recognizes, the adoption and application of general policies are both permissible and desirable, provided such policies are not applied blindly and the decision-maker remains attentive to specific circumstances: Carpenter Fishing at para 29.
[91] The distinction between policy formulation and implementation has real impacts on judicial review. First, reviewing courts must carefully differentiate between the review of general policy decisions, which are more quasi-legislative in nature, and the review of specific decisions implementing those policies, which are more administrative in nature. As the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized in Carpenter Fishing at paragraph 29, courts must not apply the standards of review appropriate to administrative decisions when assessing legislative policymaking. The Federal Court of Appeal further instructed that, where a challenge to an administrative decision indirectly attacks an underlying policy, courts should isolate the policy component and apply standards appropriate to legislative action. Consequently, courts afford

greater deference to general policy decisions, while applying more rigorous scrutiny to their specific administrative application.
[92] Second, the obligations of procedural fairness also vary depending on whether the exercise of administrative discretion involves general policy formulation or specific administrative implementation. Decisions grounded in high-level policy formulation, especially at ministerial or institutional levels, and aimed explicitly at the public interest typically trigger minimal procedural protections for individuals, with the generally viable route being challenges on grounds of abuse of discretion: David Hunt FC at para 52, citing Martineau v Matsqui Disciplinary Board, [1980] 1 SCR 602 at 628-629; Kohl at paras 19-21. In contrast, decisions that are "not of a legislative nature," delegated to frontline officials, and directly "affect[ing] the rights, privileges, or interests of an individual," attract heightened procedural fairness obligations: Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, [1985] 2 SCR 643 [Cardinal] at para 14; Knight v Indian Head School Division No. 19, [1990] 1 SCR 653 at p. 670; Blois v. Onion Lake Cree Nation, 2020 FC 953 at para 69.
(3) The "Stamping-Out" Policy
(a) Overview
[93] The Stamping-Out Policy is Canada's adaptation of internationally recognized and applied principles for managing HPAI outbreaks. It prioritizes swift elimination of infected populations rather than individual testing and disposal of affected animals. Adopted during and developed following Canada's first HPAI outbreak in British Columbia in 2004, the Policy aligns with three sequential steps of the stamping-out approach outlined by the World Organisation for Animal Health, Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Paris: WOAH, 2024)

[Terrestrial Code]: killing affected animals and those suspected of exposure, disposing of carcasses, and cleansing and disinfecting establishments. Rather than prescribing detailed operational procedures, the Stamping-Out Policy sets only high-level guidance, with specific implementation protocols developed through instruments that translate the broader Policy into individual processes and actionable steps at the field level. This approach has been maintained as a directive of general applicability across different outbreak scenarios, with implementation triggered by specific conditions. Currently, the trigger is defined in the 2022 ERP as laboratory confirmation of H5-subtype HPAI detection in domestic birds within a defined epidemiological unit.
[94] Since its inception, the Stamping-Out Policy has been consistently implemented by the CFIA as its primary strategy for managing HPAI outbreaks. Previously formalized in the 2007 and 2013 Notifiable Avian Influenza Hazard-Specific Plans [the NAI HSPs] and now operationalized through the 2022 ERP, the Policy has been found by the Agency to be the most successful method for eradicating viruses, eliminating environmental contamination, halting transmission, and reducing public health risks. The 2022 ERP sets out a flexible set of guidelines informed by past decisions, and is intended to: 1) cover situations not addressed by an existing policy; 2) allow deviation from or modification of an existing policy; 3) clarify existing policy; or 4) provide a range of adaptable policy options in varying decision-making contexts. Along with other guidelines, this instrument is regularly refined and amended, particularly when sufficiently unique situations necessitate more tailored response mechanisms.
[95] The Stamping-Out Policy's legal foundation rests in both subsection 48(1) of the Act and the long-established administrative law principle that agencies may use "soft law" instruments to

guide the exercise of their discretion without requiring an express statutory mandate: Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2020 FCA 196 at para 45, citing Thamotharem at para 56. Scientifically and operationally, the Policy is informed by international standards, particularly those set by WOAH, and by scientific research and practical considerations tailored to Canada's agricultural, biosafety, and economic realities. Canada's international commitments and trade agreements also guide the design of the Stamping-Out Policy. They also further reinforce and incentivize the consistent domestic application of the Policy to protect its international reputation and maintain market access.
[96] The Stamping-Out Policy operates as an automatic response protocol once triggered, with discretion reserved for exemptions. The overall process of administering the Policy is multistepped. In practice, the very first step of exercising discretion granted under subsection 48(1) to decide whether to destroy or to treat HPAI-infected animals has already been done at the stage when the CFIA, as a delegate of the Minister, decided to develop and adopt the Stamping-Out Policy. As a result, once a triggering laboratory result arises, the Policy functions more as an automatic response protocol rather than an occasion for fresh discretionary judgment. At that point, the roles of relevant CFIA officials are to implement the established procedures for the depopulation and destruction of animals and things, not to decide anew how to respond. As part of this process, the CFIA must define the epidemiological unit, which by default encompasses birds on the entire premises unless scientific evidence justifies a narrower designation. Once such unit is determined, all remaining steps follow according to the prescribed protocol: depopulation, disposal, and disinfection of the entire unit, along with the surveillance periods consistent with WOAH standards. Discretion remains available, however, through the

exemption process, where the CFIA evaluates on a case-by-case basis whether certain birds can be exempted under one of three narrow categories.
[97] This predominantly automatic approach, with discretion reserved for case-specific exemptions, reflects the scientific and operational realities of managing HPAI outbreaks: to counteract a virus with high transmissibility, capacity for rapid spread prior to visible clinical symptoms, and potential to seriously harm Canada's animal health, human health, and international trade interests. This unique decision-making context drives the Stamping-Out Policy's prioritization of immediate containment and depopulation to prevent further spread. It also explains why both Parliament and the judiciary have consistently endorsed the proactive, preventive philosophy underpinning both the Act and the relevant jurisprudence such as the David Hunt cases, Kohl, Paradis Honey, and River Valley Poultry Farm.
(b) International Obligations and Trade Implications
[98] The adoption and operationalization of the Stamping-Out Policy reflects Canada's commitment to fulfill binding international obligations, rather than mere domestic policy preference. Annex A(3)(b) of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures has designated the WOAH as the authoritative international standard-setting body for animal health. Unsurprisingly, Canada's major trade agreements, including Article 9.6 of the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement and Chapter 5 of the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, explicitly incorporate selected WOAH standards and condition market access to Canada's trading partners on demonstrated compliance with specific WOAH protocols.

[99] Non-compliance with the Stamping-Out Policy can cause severe national economic consequences through extended trade restrictions in at least two ways. First, Article 10.4.3 of the Terrestrial Code establishes dramatically different waiting periods for regaining HPAI-free status: only 28 days after completing stamping-out and disinfection, versus a minimum of 12 months if stamping-out is not implemented. If the Policy is not adopted or observed, this extended trade restriction period can devastate not just individual farming operations but potentially a significant portion of Canada's agricultural export sector.
[100] Second, proper adoption and observation of the Stamping-Out Policy are the bedrocks of Canada's negotiated regional containment zoning agreements, which limit trade impacts to specific geographical areas during outbreaks while allowing exports to continue from unaffected regions. Dr. Suminder Sawhney, Senior Director of Animal Import and Export at CFIA, confirms that deviations from the Policy, even for smaller-scale outbreaks involving uncommon species, could invalidate entire agreements. The resulting comprehensive trade bans could impose economic costs far exceeding the immediate costs of containing individual outbreaks and harm the broader Canadian poultry industry, not just the affected premises.
(c) Operationalization through the 2022 ERP: Trigger and Implementation
[101] The 2022 ERP is the latest instrument that operationalizes the Stamping-Out Policy. Section 7.1 of the 2022 ERP sets out the triggering mechanism for implementing the StampingOut Policy, which varies depending on whether the case is the first occurrence, known as an index case, in a province or a subsequent detection in the same province. For an index case, the policy requires both H 5 detection and pathotyping confirmation of the level of pathogenicity at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg. For any subsequent cases within

the same province, any H5 RRT-PCR positive result from a Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network approved laboratory immediately activates the Policy without requiring pathotyping.
[102] When triggered, the Policy applies uniformly to all domestic birds susceptible to avian influenza, regardless of species characteristics. Section 7.3 of the 2022 ERP states: "The classification of an IP [Infected Premises] as non-poultry does not change the eradication actions required on the IP. These will be the same as for an IP classified as non-commercial (small holding) poultry." While the 2022 ERP does distinguish between "Commercial poultry," "Noncommercial poultry," and "Non-poultry," these classifications of Infected Premises affect only trade reporting, zoning requirements, and surveillance protocols. They do not alter the fundamental eradication measures applied to the premises itself. As section 7.6 of the 2022 ERP confirms, "Regardless of the classification of an IP (7.3), individual IP actions include application of stamping out measures." Susceptibility to avian influenza - not size, commercial value, rarity, or expected lifespan - is the sole determining factor for whether a particular species falls within the Policy's scope. Consequently, all susceptible birds - from common farm species like chickens and turkeys to less frequently domesticated birds like emus and ostriches - face the same depopulation protocol when H5 or H7 is detected in an epidemiological unit.
[103] Critical to proper implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy is the determination of the "epidemiological unit," which the 2022 ERP defines in Section 7.2 as: "A group of animals with the same likelihood of exposure to the pathogenic agent." By default, this encompasses the entire premises, unless evidence demonstrates that smaller units maintain physical and functional separation. In essence, this determination of an epidemiological unit represents a scientific

assessment of exposure risk, not individual animal infection status. Once the CFIA defines the unit, every bird within it must be destroyed, except for three strictly defined exemption categories, and the environment must undergo the depopulation, disposal, and disinfection measures prescribed in the 2022 ERP Sections 7.6 through 7.8.
[104] Once triggered, the Stamping-Out Policy mandates a structured sequence of three operational phases that closely mirror those described by the Terrestrial Code. Sections 7.6 to 7.8 of the 2022 ERP outline these steps. First, depopulation requires humanely destroying all birds in the identified epidemiological unit using CFIA-approved methods. Second, disposal requires securely eliminating all carcasses and contaminated materials through biosecure methods that prevent environmental contamination. Third, premises must undergo primary cleaning and disinfection or, where infeasible, an extended 120-day fallow period at temperatures below $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for natural viral inactivation. These steps progress through a structured sequence: 1) completing the destruction phase permits disposal operations; 2) properly disposing of carcasses reduces airborne risk sufficiently to allow bird placement outside infected premises and begins a 14-day surveillance period in the surrounding control zone; 3) finishing the cleaning and disinfection phase triggers duty to notify WOAH of outbreak closure and initiates a 28-day surveillance period in the broader control area; and 4) either a 14-day post-cleaning vacancy period or 120-day fallow period permits lifting all restrictions and quarantine orders.
(d) Exemption Framework and Assessment Criteria
[105] The 2022 ERP permits three narrow exemptions from depopulation required by the Stamping-Out Policy under specific scientifically defensible circumstances: "distinct units," "rare and valuable genetics," and "pet birds." Conceptually speaking, this exemption does not

constitute a detachment of the birds in question from the Policy itself, but rather excludes said birds from the epidemiological unit to which depopulation must be applied. Pursuant to sections 7.2.1 and 7.6 as well as the Exemptions from depopulation appendix of the 2022 ERP, these exemptions all share a common threshold requirement: the birds must constitute a distinct epidemiological unit with no exposure to the virus.
[106] In addition to the basic requirement of a distinct epidemiological unit, each of the three exemption categories also has specific qualifying criteria. For "distinct units," a portion of an infected premises may qualify for exemption if it maintains both physical and functional separation from the rest of the premises. This requires demonstrating separation through factors such as dedicated ventilation systems, physical barriers, separate staff, and biosecurity protocols preventing cross-contamination. For "rare and valuable genetics," poultry lines must demonstrate high economic or genetic value and maintain status as a distinct epidemiological unit. For "pet birds," exemptions may apply where birds are kept indoors, remain clinically healthy, and form a distinct epidemiological unit separate from the exposed population.
[107] A brief clarification is warranted to avoid confusion of the similarly named terms of "distinct unit" and "distinct epidemiological unit." While closely related, these terms are not interchangeable, and thus have important differences in application. Unlike "distinct unit," which typically requires physical and infrastructural separation, "distinct epidemiological unit" turns on demonstrated epidemiological independence. This can be shown through strict health monitoring, assigned staff, and rigorous biosecurity protocols that prevent exposure to the pathogen. In practice, however, achieving this level of epidemiological independence will often require many of the same physical and functional separations associated with a "distinct unit."

[108] Assessment of exemption requests follows a rigorous, evidence-based, and discretionary process. Interdisciplinary committees like the Exemption Committee evaluate applications filled out by applicants against twenty distinct criteria related to physical separation, operational biosecurity, and risk management. As indicated on the self-assessment questionnaire in the Distinct Unit Request Package itself, any "NO" answers to these criteria likely precludes exemption. Additionally, the committees also weigh international trade and public health implications before granting an exemption. Furthermore, any exemption granted is automatically void if subsequent testing detects infection in the exempted birds, triggering the immediate application of the full Stamping-Out Policy to the previously exempted birds.
[109] The CFIA has strictly observed this distinct epidemiological unit threshold requirement in its evaluation of exemption applications. To date, it has granted only one exemption during the current outbreak: a March 2022 decision on a turkey production facility [the March 2022 Exemption]. In that case, CFIA ordered the destruction of turkeys in only two barns, while sparing those in other barns on the same premises. This limited exemption was justified by multiple biosafety measures establishing demonstrated epidemiological separation: 1) each grow-out barn maintained "distinct/separate air space in regards to ventilation"; 2) the facility implemented "various biosecurity measures...to mitigate the risk of transmission between other flocks/barns," including "shower in/shower out procedures, dedicated clothing, footwear, equipment"; and 3) "official CFIA control mechanisms... have been placed on the premise." Only after establishing the existence of a distinct epidemiological unit did the CFIA proceed to evaluate whether the facility qualified for the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption. It concluded that the spared turkeys met this criterion, as they were "high value pedigree birds that are the genetic cornerstone for the further production of commercial turkeys."

# B. The law on fettering 

[110] Fettering is a serious flaw in administrative decision-making. It unlawfully removes or abandons the discretion that legislatures intended to be exercised in relation to individual cases: Vavilov at para 108, citing Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Lukács, 2018 SCC 2 at para 18. Fettering occurs when decision-makers blindly follow soft law instruments as if they were binding law, without genuinely considering how to exercise their discretion in the specific circumstances: Thamotharem at para 62; Stemijon Investments Ltd v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 299 [Stemijon Investments] at para 22, citing Maple Lodge Farms at p 6.
[111] However, merely showing that decision-makers were "influenced significantly by... policy and its objectives" falls short of establishing the requisite "blindness" to constitute fettering, as influence alone does not show that decision-makers "afforded no consideration to the possibility of" pursuing an alternative course: Publicover v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 659 at para 54; Thamotharem at para 59. Applicants bear the burden of showing that the decision-maker treated the policy as binding, ignoring their duty to exercise independent judgment based on the facts of each case: Shin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FC 1106.
[112] Once a court finds that discretion has been fettered, the decision must be set aside, as "a decision that is the product of a fettered discretion must per se be unreasonable:" Stemijon Investments at para 24; Barco v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 421 at para 20; Gordon v Canada (Attorney General), 2016 FC 643 at para 28. No degree of deference can cure the flaw that flows from fettering.

[113] The prevailing view is that fettering does not engage a standard of review analysis in the usual sense. While some cases, such as Singh Bajwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 864 at para 46 have suggested that correctness may apply, the now prevailing view in the Federal Courts is that the core question is simply whether the decision was, in fact, the result of fettered discretion: Desgagnés Transarctik Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 14 at para 65; Austin v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1277 at para 16; Matharoo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 664 at para21; Yanasik v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 1319 at para 25.
[114] The Federal Courts have identified key factors to watch for within policy instruments for distinguishing between permissible guidance and impermissible fettering. In paragraph 64 of Thamotharem, the Federal Court of Appeal endorsed the approach from Ainsley Financial Corp. v Ontario Securities Commission, [1994] OJ No 2966 [Ainsley], which examines: 1) the language of the instrument; 2) the practical effect of non-compliance; and 3) the expectations of the agency and its staff regarding implementation. A policy that uses mandatory language, prescribes detailed procedures, threatens sanctions for non-compliance, and is treated by staff as binding law, is more likely to amount to fettering. The key question is whether a decision is made "solely by reference to the mandatory prescription of a guideline, despite a request to deviate from it in the light of the particular facts:" Thamotharem at para 62.
[115] Two Federal Court cases applying section 48 of the Act have further clarified the distinction between permissible policy guidance and impermissible fettering in the multi-step decision-making of infected animal disposal. In David Hunt FC, Justice Cullen found that fettering cannot arise where no independent judgment remained at the implementation level.

That case involved a district veterinarian tasked with destroying cattle imported from the United Kingdom. The destruction decision followed a pre-established blanket policy directing that all cattle imported before 1990 be culled. Because the Minister had already made a categorical policy decision at the national level, the field officer's role was purely mechanical. Justice Cullen held that because no individual discretion survived at the field level, there was nothing left to fetter, a conclusion upheld on appeal: David Hunt FC at paras 33-37, aff'd David Hunt FCA at paras 3-7.
[116] In Jerram, the exercise of the same statutory power was upheld for the opposite reason: Justice Noël found that the regional inspector had residual discretion and genuinely exercised it. Specifically, the inspector "personally ascertained the circumstances of the subject bull," and then, during cross-examination, "referred to the decision... as his own" and "confirmed his conviction that the bull had to be destroyed": Jerram at para 35. Justice Noël emphasized that while the national policy strongly favoured destruction, it did not compel that outcome in every case. Therefore, what proved determinative was that the inspector's suspicion was genuinely formed and supported by evidence specific to the individual animal in question: Jerram at paras 42-52.
[117] These animal disease-control cases yield two foundational principles for analyzing fettering in multi-step administrative processes guided by a policy instrument. First, discretion must be understood as a unified whole across the entire process. Whether discretion of the overall process is fettered cannot be judged by looking at individual decision points in isolation. It must instead be assessed holistically, considering whether, when aggregated across the process, the appropriate overall level of discretion is preserved. Second, varying levels of

discretion at different stages are permissible, provided that the process preserves the proportional discretionary authority mandated by statute. This framework explains why the outcomes in the David Hunt cases and Jerram align despite differing levels of in-field discretion. In the former, discretion was concentrated at earlier, ministerial stages, leaving implementation largely mechanical. For the latter, the policy left field-level officials with some meaningful discretionary power to assess the situation before them. Neither caused fettering because the decision-makers in each case properly exercised the discretion allocated to them within the respective policy frameworks.
[118] To summarize, when reviewing fettering claims in multi-phase administrative processes, courts should make two key considerations:

1) Evaluate the architecture of the entire administrative process to determine whether it as a whole preserves sufficient discretion for case-specific judgment or unlawfully diminishes discretion. This is a qualitative assessment of whether the overall process maintains discretionary power proportionate to what is granted by the statute or improperly removes or abandons discretion; and
2) Examine the specific decision-making step under review to determine how much discretion, if any, was left to the decision-maker at that step, and whether the individual properly exercised that discretion. This is the more traditional fettering inquiry, centered on whether the decision-maker treated non-binding soft law as legally binding.

# C. The law on legitimate expectation 

[119] The doctrine of legitimate expectation is a core part of the procedural fairness principle. If an applicant has a legitimate expectation that a certain procedure will be followed, this procedure will be required by the duty of fairness: Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para 26; Agraira v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36 [Agraira] at paras 94-95.
[120] To establish a legitimate expectation, applicants must demonstrate that the relevant public authority has made clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representations about the procedure it will follow, or have consistently adhered to certain procedural practices in the past: Canada (Attorney General) v Mavi, 2011 SCC 30 [Mavi] at para 68. Moreover, the representations must be within the authority's power to make, and applicants must have reasonably relied on the representations: Agraira at para 94.
[121] Applicants are entitled to rely on the administrative body's established procedures and publicly available policies, even if they are in general not legally binding. A failure by the decision-maker to follow its own procedures, or a unilateral departure from established practices without notice, may constitute a breach of procedural fairness: Tafreshi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 1089 at para 18; Kandiah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1096 [Kandiah] at paras 25-27.
[122] When an administrative body changes or deviates from its procedures in a way that affects applicants, procedural fairness may require that affected individuals be given notice of the changes and an opportunity to adjust or comply with the new procedures, especially if the

changes or deviations could have significant or "fatal" consequences: Kandiah at paras 26-27; Popova v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 326 at para 11.
[123] However, the law is clear that the doctrine of legitimate expectation creates only procedural rights, not substantive ones: Agraira at para 97; Chelsea (Municipality) v Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FCA 89 at para 36. Even if an individual had "a legitimate expectation that a particular outcome will be reached, that expectation is not enforceable": Canada (National Revenue) v JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc, 2013 FCA 250 [JP Morgan] at para 75; Jennings-Clyde, Inc. (Vivatas, Inc.) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2024 FC 1141 [JenningsClyde] at para 40.
VIII. Analysis
A. Evidentiary issues: expert reports, affidavit, and Report of Inspector
(1) There is No Need to Rule on the Admissibility and Weight of the Expert Reports
[124] I do not need to rule on the admissibility or weight of the challenged portions of the parties' expert reports, as the issues in this judicial review do not require weighing the scientific or technical insights they offer to properly conduct the reasonableness analysis. In fact, since the parties have marshalled their expert reports specifically to attack or defend the merits of the Stamping-Out Policy, examining and weighing these reports would lead to assessment of the Policy's merits. As described in the Legal Framework section, courts at all levels have consistently held that the merits of policy decisions are strictly off limits in a reasonableness review: Entertainment Software; South Shore; Kohl; Auer.

[125] The parties, especially the Applicant, have staked much of their respective cases on competing visions of the science and practice of avian-influenza control, and each vision is carried almost entirely through expert opinion. The Applicant's expert suite consists of three individuals drawn from outside of public service. Collectively, their reports are deployed by the Applicant attempting to show that the measures offered by the Stamping-Out Policy are neither scientifically supported nor the least-intrusive means available and, therefore, unreasonable in law.
[126] I summarize below in very broad strokes the key opinions offered in the expert reports submitted by both sides.
[127] Dr. Steven Pelech, a UBC professor and biochemist with years of training and experience in immunology and virology, supplies in his two reports the central thesis that the H5N1 detected at the Applicant's farm behaved phenotypically like a low-pathogenic strain. He cites as evidence the low mortality of adult birds, short-lived viral shedding, and the flock's likely attainment of immunity to the virus by mid-January. Dr. Pelech's conclusion goes to the heart of the Applicant's claim that CFIA's response failed to consider the disproportionality of implementing the Stamping-Out Policy on its premises as well as the lack of consideration of monitoring and further research, and therefore is unreasonable.
[128] Dr. Byram Bridle, an immunologist at the University of Guelph with research focused on virology, also furnishes microbiology and immunology opinions. He argues that detecting an H5 gene by RRT-PCR is not, without full pathotyping, proof of a highly pathogenic virus. Faced

with a novel genotype, he opines, CFIA should first have performed a fresh risk assessment and considered vaccination or natural-immunity studies.
[129] Dr. Jeff Wilson, a current director of a veterinary science and infectious disease management consulting firm and former senior epidemiologist and manager at the Public Health Agency of Canada, overlays Dr. Pelech and Dr. Birdle's microbiology and immunology opinions with his epidemiological knowledge. Ostriches, Dr. Wilson says, live longer, range farther, and populate at far lower densities than conventional poultry, so close surveillance and targeted culling would have met international obligations with less collateral loss. Dr. Wilson further frames CFIA actions in adopting and implementing the Stamping-Out Policy as a policy failure when benchmarked against proper pandemic-response principles.
[130] The Respondent's scientific foundation rests on a single report by Dr. Shannon French, a CFIA veterinary epidemiologist who completed her doctorate research on the wildlife disease ecology of parasites and received various post-graduate trainings on epidemiology, virology, and poultry health management. Dr. French traces the full-genome sequencing that identified the virus on the Applicant's premises as a new HPAI H5N1 lineage, reviews international outbreak data illustrating silent but intense viral shedding in ratites, and explains why neither vaccination nor a "burn-out" strategy has gained WOAH endorsement for commercial poultry.
[131] Unsurprisingly, each side seeks to narrow the evidentiary footprint of the other, and asks this Court to rely on the opinion of their experts should opinions diverge. For the Respondent's expert report, the Applicant takes issue with Dr. French's impartiality, arguing that she joined CFIA as a doctoral student in 2020, and claiming her report strays into advocacy by endorsing

the very policy under review. They also attempt to undermine the accuracy and credibility of her opinion on the characterization of the virus found on the Applicant's premises as an HPAI by pointing to her lack of specialized qualifications and experience focused on virology or immunology. The Applicant's counsel has not pinpointed any specific portions or paragraphs of Dr. French's affidavit that they ask to be struck or given no weight.
[132] For its part, the Respondent launches a two-pronged counterattack. It moves to strike 24 different portions of the Pelech, Wilson, and Bridle reports on the grounds that: 1) none of the authors have ever worked with ostrich production under outbreak conditions; 2) they rely on post-decision data and speculative modelling rather than contemporaneous evidence; and 3) their "herd-immunity" thesis sits well outside mainstream peer-reviewed literature. The Respondent also underlines that Drs. Pelech and Bridle have been criticized by courts in other legal proceedings for advocacy masquerading as expertise and have had their reports rejected. Concurrently, the Respondent defends Dr. French's credibility by pointing to her systematic review of relevant peer-reviewed literature, her concessions where data are uncertain, and the fact that her conclusions line up with WOAH manuals and with the culling protocol upon HPAI outbreaks in ostriches in South Africa, where the Applicant's line of flock reportedly originated.
[133] As previewed in the beginning of this section, I do not need to resolve the parties' battle over the admissibility and weight of their expert material. The dispute they invite the Court to referee is, in substance, a contest over whose science on the virus in question is "better" and therefore whose preferred animal and public health policy is "wiser." To decide a winner in this contest will cause this Court to commit two cardinal sins in reasonableness review. First, it will prompt this Court to reach beyond the legitimate scope of reasonableness review of a broad

policy decision. Second, it will effectively make this Court an academy of science and an arbiter of truth in immunology and animal and public health.
[134] To reiterate, under Vavilov, this Court's task on this judicial review is to decide whether the Stamping-Out Policy, when read considering its enabling statute, falls within a range of outcomes that can be said to be rational, intelligible and justified. As the Federal Court of Appeal explained in Entertainment Software, decisions "very much unconstrained" by tight statutory language or adjudicative methodology, namely policy decisions with broad public interest implications, are correspondingly "harder to set aside" because merits-based disagreement is not a ground for intervention. The Stamping-Out Policy under review is precisely of that character. Like the policy decisions examined in South Shore and Kohl, it is a preventative, nationwide disease-control measure adopted to proactively manage and eradicate a serious threat to animal and public health, as well as international trade. As Auer teaches us, for such decisions, the reviewing court asks whether the policy can plausibly be located within the text, purpose and architecture of the Act, not whether it represents the optimal balance of virological, economic, or public health considerations.
[135] The rivalling expert reports add fuel to precisely such an inadmissible balancing exercise. The Applicant's evidence says the Stamping-Out Policy is economically wasteful, scientifically unnecessary, and ineffective, especially when it comes to the less studied situation of ostriches. The Respondent's evidence says it has been effective, epidemiologically indispensable, and trade-critical. Accepting either view would require me to adjudicate the substantive merits of the policy and, as support, to resolve contested matters of viral pathogenicity, host biology, export-

market tolerance of policy changes and the like, a task the case law forbids: Coldwater First Nation at 119; Inverhuron at 40.
[136] Nor is it necessary to parse the expert evidence for the limited purpose of checking whether the CFIA had some evidentiary foundation to support its suspicion of HPAI infection and implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy during this wave of HPAI outbreak, including in the Applicant's situation specifically. The record already contains unchallenged factual materials, such as the existence of positive RRT-PCR results, whole-genome sequencing report, and information on contemporaneous HPAI outbreaks, on which the reasonableness of the suspicion and continuation of the Policy can be assessed. Whether different scientists might have drawn different risk conclusions, and which assessment this Court might prefer, is irrelevant to the reasonableness review at hand.
[137] In short, the parties' expert reports, however scientifically accurate, provide opinions on scientific truth, the weighing of which lies with the specialized administrative bodies, which are better positioned to assess the comparative prudence, efficacy, or proportionality of animal disease-control measures of general applicability. These are questions of policy merit and have no role in the reasonableness analysis of administrative decisions. For that reason, I decline to rule on the admissibility of the expert reports and afford them no weight in my reasons.
(2) Dr. Cathy Furness' Affidavit is Admissible as Factual Narrative
[138] I find Dr. Cathy Furness' affidavit, tendered by the Respondent, admissible. To the extent that her affidavit refers to scientific concepts, these statements provide factual context for understanding CFIA's regulatory decisions rather than offering scientific or technical

conclusions that would require expert qualification. Additionally, I treat those statements as factual narrative explaining what the CFIA understands and considers in its decision-making, not as definitive statements of scientific truth. I therefore find no basis to exclude Dr. Furness' affidavit or disregard portions of it as impermissible expert evidence.
[139] Dr. Furness is the Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer of the CFIA. Her affidavit offers background on the CFIA's understanding of the current HPAI outbreak that began in November 2021, the HPAI H5N1 virus detected at the Applicant's premises, and Canada's international obligations to implement the Stamping-Out Policy upon detection of HPAI. It also explains how the Stamping-Out Policy facilitates a faster return to disease-free status according to relevant international treaty, protects Canada's export markets through negotiated trade agreements, and supports coordinated global efforts to reduce public health risks from this zoonotic disease. The affidavit further details the Agency's legal authority under the Act, the specific application of these policies to the UOF case including the denial of their exemption request, and the coordinated federal-provincial response framework between CFIA and British Columbia authorities.
[140] The Applicant's counsel first raised their objection to the admissibility of this affidavit at the hearing. They insist that Dr. Furness' affidavit is inadmissible because it contains statements that offer opinion on technical and scientific matters, but is never tendered as an expert report properly qualified under Rule 52.2 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106. However, they did not identify any specific paragraphs or portions of the affidavit they sought to have struck or disregarded.

[141] The Respondent's counsel objected to the Applicant's challenge, noting that the case management judge had directed the parties identify any admissibility objections in advance of the hearing. Respondent's counsel argued that raising the challenge for the first time at the hearing was contrary to that direction. Respondent's counsel also asked for the specific parts of Dr. Furness' affidavit which the Applicant's counsel had challenged, so that they could address it in their submission. I agreed with the Respondent at the hearing on the request for clarification and pressed the Applicant to identify the challenged portions. In response, Applicant's counsel stated: "it is quite obvious when you read [Dr. Furness'] report where she is offering virology or immunology opinions."
[142] I am of the view that the Applicant's evidentiary challenge here must fail, if not for the fact that it did not observe case management procedures, than for the fact that, contrary to what the Applicant's counsel claims, Dr. Furness' affidavit does not obviously contain the type of statement that veers into expert evidence on virology and immunology.
[143] Having carefully reviewed Dr. Furness' affidavit in detail, I find this characterization inaccurate. The statements contained therein predominantly consist of facts that one would expect a Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer to possess through her official position, responsibilities, and direct involvement in Canada's HPAI response. Jurisprudence is clear that such information does not constitute "expert information, since it was not the kind of information that could only be acquired and understood with special training or expertise," but rather information gained through knowledge, observation, and experience in the ordinary course of one's position: R. v Millard, 2023 ONCA 426 at para 108; R. v Hamilton, 2011 ONCA 399 at para 277.

[144] For example, when Dr. Furness describes avian influenza variants being categorized into HPAI and LPAI strains or identifies which subtypes are listed in the Reportable Diseases Regulations, SOR/91-2, she is stating factual information learned from her responsibilities, not offering specialized scientific opinions that require specialized training. Similarly, when describing the current outbreak timeline, detection of specific virus subtypes, or international standards for response, Dr. Furness is stating facts directly accessible in her role. Her statements about the absence of effective treatments for HPAI in birds represent factual declarations about available options within CFIA's policy framework, not scientific opinions on treatment efficacy. These are matters that would reasonably be known to anyone in her position without requiring special expertise beyond what is necessary for her role. It is particularly telling that, when making these statements, she cites and attaches supporting documentation as exhibits, which include fact sheets and publications from authorities such as the Public Health Agency of Canada and the World Health Organization. In other words, Dr. Furness is recounting and relaying information from these established sources, rather than communicating her opinions on scientific matters.
[145] The remaining portions of Dr. Furness' affidavit similarly consist of factual statements, such as descriptions of relevant WOAH standards, CFIA internal processes, and federalprovincial coordination frameworks, all of which fall within the realm of factual narrative. Her account of the Stamping-Out Policy's requirements and the consequences for disease-free status restates international standards that guide the CFIA's work. Her descriptions of the CFIA's emergency response framework, hazard-specific plans, and operational procedures reflect institutional knowledge directly linked to her official role. When detailing the coordinated response with British Columbia authorities, including the liaison officer structure, weekly

meetings, and information-sharing protocols, Dr. Furness provides facts about administrative arrangements known to her through ordinary professional experience, not through specialized scientific training. These are precisely the kinds of statements expected from a senior public official addressing matters within her regulatory and operational mandate, not scientific opinions based on specialized training and expertise.
(3) The Respondent's Report of the CFIA Inspector is Admissible Under the Business Record Exception
[146] The last piece of evidentiary dispute I must address before turning to the substance of the reasonableness analysis is whether the one-page "Inspection Report" dated January 31, 2025, and tendered as Exhibit O to the affidavit of Dr. Cathy Furness, may be received as evidence of what occurred during CFIA Inspector Dykstra's onsite visit of and the testing done at the Applicant's premises on December 30, 2024. I find that it is, based on the business record exception provided by section 30 of the Canada Evidence Act, RSC 1985, c C-5 [the CEA].
[147] The Inspection Report is a formal summary of the site visit of the Applicant's premises conducted by Inspector Dykstra, with particular focus on the availability of carcasses for sampling and the applicable biosecurity measure. The Report shows that Inspector Dykstra explained that "he would like to swab up to ten mortalities," but the Applicant's principal who accompanied him "stated there were only two mortalities in good enough condition to be sampled" since "the remaining mortalities had either been scavenged on by wild animals or were in later stages of decomposition." The Applicant contests this account, alleging that Inspector Dykstra refused additional carcasses despite being offered more. Based on this alternative version of events, the Applicant argues that the CFIA failed to comply with section 4 of the 2022

ERP, which requires sampling of all available dead birds up to ten at maximum, and therefore lacked a sufficient factual foundation for reasonably issuing the Notice to Dispose.
[148] The Applicant submits that the Report of Inspector should be struck as inadmissible hearsay that falls outside of the business record exception, applying evaluative frameworks in Ares v Venner, [1970] SCR 608 [Ares] and Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v Teva Canada Limited, 2017 FC 88 [Eli Lilly]. The Applicant advances three main arguments in support of this position. First, the Report lacks contemporaneity, as it was signed a month after the site visit without explanation for the delay. Second, the way the Report is tendered does not satisfy the personal knowledge element, since Inspector Dykstra did not provide direct evidence about the circumstances surrounding its creation. Third, the Report lacks independence, asserting that it was prepared "in contemplation of litigation," given that the CFIA had been notified of the Applicant's intention to seek judicial review of the Notice to Dispose shortly before the Report was finalized.
[149] The Applicant's objections rest on a misunderstanding of the law and a failure to read the Report of Inspector in conjunction with other similar reports furnished by the Respondent. The legal error concerns the requirement for personal knowledge. The Applicant's counsel specifically emphasized during the hearing that "we have no evidence from... Dykstra... the inspector, as to how and why he created the record a month later, the circumstances surrounding his creation of it." This submission misstates what is required to satisfy the personal knowledge requirement. The correct inquiry is whether the author of the document, in this case Inspector Dykstra, had personal knowledge of the matters being recorded, not whether the document must be tendered and supported by a direct attestation from that author personally.

[150] As the Supreme Court held in Ares, the reliability of business records arises from the circumstances of their creation, not the presence of the author:

Hospital records, including nurses' notes, made contemporaneously by someone having a personal knowledge of the matters then being recorded and under a duty to make the entry or record should be received in evidence as prima facie proof of the facts stated therein.
[151] The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the notion that the author's testimony is required to validate such records, pointing to the impracticality of demanding testimony from specific individuals in large organizations where "clerks and servants are changed from time to time, whose evidence may be difficult and often impossible to obtain": Ares at p 619, citing Ashdown Hardware Co. v Singer et al (1951), 3 WWR (NS) 145 (AD CA). This understanding of the personal knowledge element has not been modified by this Court in Eli Lilly, nor by the Federal Court of Appeal on appeal: Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v Teva Canada Limited, 2018 FCA 53. Accordingly, the relevant inquiry here is whether the author of the record, Inspector Dykstra, had firsthand knowledge of the events recorded. Whether he provided a direct attestation about the context in which the report was created is irrelevant. That function was properly fulfilled by Dr. Furness, who has explained in her affidavit about how the preparation of such reports are done in the ordinary course of business at the CFIA.
[152] The business record exception exists because institutional safeguards enhance reliability. The Applicant's insistence on requiring direct evidence from Inspector Dykstra misapprehends this underlying rationale of the exception. It is neither practical nor necessary to call every author of a record when institutional practices ensure its trustworthiness. In a national agency like the CFIA, where frontline officers like Inspector Dykstra routinely document field

observations as part of their statutory duties, the absence of an affidavit from the author, who clearly had personal knowledge presented in the Report, does not undermine its reliability. This is particularly so where Dr. Furness, a senior CFIA official with institutional knowledge, has provided an affidavit situating the Report within the broader decision-making and operational context of the Agency.
[153] The Applicant's failure to consider the Report of Inspector within the context of the record undermines its submission regarding its contemporaneity and independence. Parties do not dispute that the Report, as presented in Exhibit O, although documenting events from a site visit on December 31, 2024, was created and signed on January 31, 2025. The difference in dates is apparent. Equally apparent, however, as noted the Respondent, are the detailed, timestamped entries throughout the Report. A comparison with two other Reports of Inspector reinforces this pattern: one was again prepared and signed by Inspector Dykstra on January 20, 2025, to describe another site visit on January 7, 2025, and another by the Applicant's Case Officer on January 23 to record all interactions with the Applicant between January 2 and 10, 2025. All three reports use the same forms and format, include detailed entries that were timestamped, and are prepared and signed weeks after the events they describe.
[154] The central concern underlying the requirements of contemporaneity and independence is the reliability of the tendered documentation: Cowichan Tribes v Canada (Attorney General), 2020 BCSC 357 paras 29-40; R. v Farhan, 2013 ONSC 7094 at para 12, citing Performing Rights Organization of Canada Ltd. v Lion d'or (1981) Ltée, [1987] FCJ No 934 at p 3. In my view, the consistent use of standardized forms, the inclusion of detailed and timestamped entries, and the common institutional practice of preparing and signing reports after the events described

are strong indicators of reliability. These features, which are all present in the Report of Inspector in dispute, demonstrate contemporaneous notetaking with formal compilation into the report-format occurring later, and thus they enhance the reliability of evidence that the business records exception is intended to ensure.
[155] Moreover, there is no evidence that the Report was prepared "in contemplation of litigation," aside from its date. Strategically, there would have been little reason for the Respondent to fabricate information about the number of carcasses available, since section 7.1 of the 2022 ERP sets the key trigger for the issuance of a Notice to Dispose as the detection of "H5 Avian Influenza by RRT-PCR," not by the number of carcasses swabbed or number of samples collected. The Respondent gains nothing by claiming only two carcasses were available rather than more. In short, the Report of Inspector is not necessary to justify the reasonableness of issuing the Notice to Dispose. Its evidentiary necessity lies more in describing the occurrence of carcass decomposition and scavenging, which, along with other epidemiological evidence, demonstrates the transmission pathways and poor biosafety practices on the Applicant's farm, and informs the broader risk assessment underpinning the CFIA's decision-making in the Applicant's case.
[156] On a balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the Report of Inspector is "made in the usual and ordinary course of business" as required by section 30 of the CEA, and is therefore admissible.

# B. The Stamping-Out Policy is reasonable 

[157] I agree with the Respondent that the Stamping-Out Policy is reasonable in law, for it aligns with the text, structure, and purpose of the Act. As explained in the Legal Framework section, Parliament has delegated broad power to the Minister and their delegates under section 48 to protect public health and preserve the health of humans and animals in Canada as well as Canada's international trade status by proactively preventing and controlling animal disease outbreaks and reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission. The Stamping-Out Policy represents a legitimate policy-level exercise of this discretion, grounded in a science-informed framework that mandates swift depopulation following laboratory confirmation of H5 avian influenza. The Policy is further operationalized by measures aimed at halting viral amplification, permitting sanitization of affected premises, and facilitating the rapid restoration of disease-free status. Additionally, the CFIA complements these measures by providing operators with postdepopulation biosecurity guidance tailored to minimize future infection risks, further promoting the Act's proactive approach to disease control.
[158] Since the Applicant does not allege any inconsistency between the Stamping-Out Policy and the text or scheme of the pertinent provisions of the Act, the central inquiry is whether the Policy remains consistent with the Act's legislative purposes. It is important to remember that ongoing outbreaks among wild or domestic birds do not, by themselves, render the Policy incompatible with statutory objectives. The jurisprudence has made clear that the Act does not demand instantaneous or perfect eradication of specific pathogens. Rather, Parliament expects regulatory measures that can significantly mitigate disease spread, limit viral amplification, and reduce mutation and cross-species transmission risks. It is through this lens of mitigation and

risk reduction, not absolute eradication, that this Court must assess the Applicant's challenges regarding the Policy's consistency with the Act's purpose and, by extension, its reasonableness.
[159] Although the Applicant has not explicitly categorized its arguments under a specific heading such as "Policy Unreasonableness," two core claims challenging the reasonableness of the Stamping-Out Policy can be synthesized from various parts of its submissions. In essence, the Applicant's position is that, first, the Policy has demonstrably failed to achieve its legislative objectives and, second, the scientific basis underpinning the Policy is outdated and thus cannot advance the objectives of the Act as intended. On this basis, the Applicant contends that the Policy must be rejected as unreasonable under Vavilov, even considering the significant deference typically paid to broad policy decisions involving public interest considerations.
[160] On the flaw of empirical ineffectiveness, the Applicant submits that the Stamping-Out Policy has not achieved its stated goals and thus cannot advance the statutory mandate of the Act. The Applicant highlights the destruction of approximately 14.5 million birds since early 2022, alongside Canada's ongoing reports of hundreds of new H5N1 detections, including repeated infections on previously cleared premises. In the Applicant's submission, this shows the Policy has failed to meaningfully contain or eradicate HPAI and therefore no longer constitutes a measure within the defensible range of reasonableness.
[161] Concerning outdated scientific assumptions, the Applicant argues the CFIA has inappropriately adopted the Stamping-Out Policy based on the unscientific assumption that any detection of H5N1 indicates uniformly high pathogenicity and therefore requires immediate depopulation. According to the Applicant, this approach disregards emerging scientific research

regarding subclinical or silent infection in ratites, the polyphyletic group that includes ostriches, and neglects the CFIA's own data showing brief viral shedding periods among these birds. Additionally, the Applicant emphasizes that such approach completely neglects the novel genotype of the avian influenza virus detected on its farm, which its experts describe as being associated with lower adult mortality rates and quicker recovery times. Since the Stamping-Out Policy was formulated before these recent scientific developments and clinical observations, and has not been substantively revised in response, the Applicant submits that the Policy's foundational scientific assumptions are outdated, undermining its reasonableness as a continuing mechanism to advance the statutory objectives of the Act.
[162] I cannot accept the Applicant's positions. Both of the Applicant's core policy-level criticisms invite this Court to engage in precisely the kind of assessment that Vavilov, Entertainment Software, South Shore, Kohl, and Auer say reviewing courts must not do: arbitrating scientific disputes, reassessing social and economic trade-offs, and pronouncing on the empirical effectiveness of broad public-interest policies. Those are tasks that are better left to the agencies like the CFIA that wield administrative and technical expertise. This Court's role, by contrast, is confined to determining whether the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy fits rationally within the Act's text, scheme, and purpose, given the legal and factual constraints that bear on the Minister and their delegates. It is not to decide whether the CFIA's chosen balance of virology, trade protection, public-health precaution and animal-health logistics is the best or the most up-to-date, or whether the Applicant's proposed policy changes are the better or more up-to-date ones.

[163] First, the allegation of "empirical ineffectiveness" improperly invites the Court to substitute its own metric of success and understanding of science for those of the CFIA. Questions about the overall success of the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy, its comparative effectiveness against alternative disease-control strategies, or how to interpret epidemiological data, lie beyond judicial review and are not for this Court to answer. So long as the CFIA's adoption of the Stamping-Out Policy remains linked to the Act's objectives, this Court must refrain from second-guessing the policy choices of the Agency to which Parliament has assigned responsibility for managing animal health and disease control.
[164] Evaluated within this proper scope of judicial review, the record supports the conclusion that the CFIA's application of the Stamping-Out Policy continues to advance the objectives of the Act. In his affidavit and during cross-examination, Dr. Harchaoui, Laboratory Network Director in the CFIA's Science Branch, affirmed that the Agency tracks key performance indicators such as timeliness of detection, speed of depopulation, viral clearance, duration of movement controls, and re-listing of zones for trade purposes. These indicators, he stated, have improved consistently since 2004. He also confirmed that Canada, like most WOAH member countries, continues to regard stamping-out as the most effective approach for rapidly regaining disease-free status and lowering mutation risks. Dr. Furness similarly confirmed during crossexamination that, through application of the Policy combined with robust biosecurity measures, the CFIA limited H5N1 outbreaks during the current wave to 527 of more than 30,000 poultry premises. These points were not disputed by the Applicant's counsel during cross-examination or at the hearing. On this record, I find no basis to conclude that the Stamping-Out Policy is incompatible with the purposes of the Act.

[165] Second, the Applicant's contention regarding "outdated science" similarly calls upon the Court to engage in an impermissible reassessment of the CFIA's scientific and policy determinations. The Applicant contends that the CFIA's continued reliance on a policy developed in 2004, with little efforts to update it to "accord with what's actually happening," is unreasonable, especially when recent scientific literature undermines the effectiveness of mass culling. However, this assertion is not supported by the record. The record, particularly as developed during cross-examination of CFIA officials by the Applicant's counsel, clearly demonstrates that the CFIA has continually refined and updated the Stamping-Out Policy since its initial formulation.
[166] For instance, the 2013 NAI HSP revisions incorporated lessons from prior outbreaks and drew upon multidisciplinary expertise, extensive literature reviews, international coordination, most notably with U.S. counterparts, and consultations with Canadian poultry industry stakeholders. These continuous updates and refinements have persisted through to the current 2022 ERP instrument, which integrates ongoing decision records, regular multidisciplinary reviews, and international expert consultations, including with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal \& Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS].
[167] Besides refinements to specific policy guides, the CFIA has also consistently explored alternatives to the Stamping-Out Policy itself throughout the years, including vaccination, containment strategies such as "burn out," and selective culling. The 2013 NAI HSP specifically contemplated a "burning out" option for LPAI strains in remote, non-commercial premises with inadequate resources, though this option was removed from the 2022 ERP due to the greater risks to animal health, public health and the environment caused by the spread of HPAI. In

December 2022, the CFIA conducted extensive consultations in response to requests from poultry producers in British Columbia to apply selective killing rather than complete stamping out. These consultations were both internal and external. The Agency weighed the benefits and harms of selective killing, specifically factors such as increased prevalence of HPAI, the immediate loss of some international markets, and a potential increase in resources required in the longer term for surveillance, and delayed depopulation procedures. Ultimately, the CFIA concluded that the Stamping-Out Policy remained the most effective in controlling the spread of highly infectious HPAI to other flocks, wild birds and mammals, including humans, while also maintaining alignment with the internationally accepted approach to HPAI management and control.
[168] All these extensive, iterative, and consultative review and update processes directly address the only question properly before this Court on this point: whether the CFIA has remained responsive to evolving scientific and policy developments, and nonetheless determined, on reasoned grounds and with material factors considered, that continued application of the Stamping-Out Policy properly advances the objectives of the Act. The record before me supports a resounding answer in the affirmative. Whether the Applicant's experts might weigh scientific data differently, or prefer alternative policy approaches, is irrelevant to the reasonableness review that this Court must conduct here.
[169] In sum, the Applicant's arguments are in substance disagreements about the scientific foundations and policy merit judgments underpinning the Stamping-Out Policy, rather than a demonstration of statutory incompatibility. Applying Vavilov and Auer, I am satisfied that the

Stamping-Out Policy, as operationalized by the 2022 ERP, remains reasonable and consistent with the Act.
C. The implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy in this case withstands judicial scrutiny
(1) The Applicant's Two New Arguments Raised at the Hearing Are Unpersuasive
[170] At the hearing, when challenging the reasonableness of applying the Stamping-Out Policy to the Applicant's case, counsel for the Applicant raised two arguments that were not included in their memorandum of fact and law. First, they argued that the CFIA's decisions were premised on a mistaken factual assumption. Namely, that the virus present on the farm was indeed HPAI under the definition of WOAH's Terrestrial Code, rather than what the Code defines to be an "emerging disease." If that assumption were mistaken, counsel argued, the decisions would necessarily be unreasonable, as the issuance of the Notice to Dispose under the Stamping-Out Policy is triggered specifically by the detection of HPAI. Second, they contended that the CFIA misinterpreted the definition of "poultry" in the Terrestrial Code, leading to the improper classification of the ostriches as poultry subject to the Policy. But for that misclassification, counsel argued, the Stamping-Out Policy would not have applied to the ostriches, and the CFIA's subsequent decisions dependent on that misclassification would therefore be unreasonable.
[171] I reminded counsel of the basic principle in Federal Courts practice that "only arguments included in a party's memorandum should be advanced in oral argument": Bridgen v Canada (Correctional Service), 2014 FCA 237 [Bridgen] at para 35; Sandhu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] FCJ No 902 (FCA) at para 4; Sibomana v Canada, 2020 FCA 57 at para 6. In response, counsel submitted that one of the arguments could be inferred

from one sentence in the Statement of Facts section of their memorandum, while notice of the other had been communicated to the Respondent prior to the hearing.
[172] Neither of these two submissions comes close to meeting the bright line threshold set by the jurisprudence for arguments that may be advanced during oral submissions. If an argument is not set out in argumentative form in a party's memorandum of fact and law, it is not properly before the Court at the hearing. I advised counsel at the hearing that I could decline to consider these arguments on that basis alone.
[173] However, I find that it is in the interests of justice to entertain the new arguments. Whether such new arguments should be considered is a discretionary decision to be guided by the balancing of the interests of justice as they affect all parties: Quan v Cusson, 2009 SCC 62 at paras 36-37; President's Choice Bank v Canada, 2024 FCA 135 at para 47; Koch v Borgatti Estate, 2022 FCA 201 at para 67; Kaiman v. Graham, 2009 ONCA 77 at para 18.
[174] Three considerations support engaging with the new arguments. First, addressing the substance of these arguments allows for a necessary clarification of the relationship between the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy and the WOAH's Terrestrial Code, and a better understanding of the precise triggering mechanism for issuing a Notice to Dispose under the 2022 ERP. This clarification not only assists in resolving the issues raised in this case, but also may provide guidance for future judicial reviews involving the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy. Second, the Respondent has already presented extensive counterarguments during the hearing and expressly stated that its position could succeed based solely on the existing evidentiary record. Notably, the Respondent did not object when the Applicant's counsel devoted considerable time in oral

submissions to advancing their new arguments. Third, the record before this Court provides a sufficient factual foundation for ruling on these issues without requiring further evidentiary submissions from either party. In these circumstances, and considering the significant consequences the CFIA's decisions have had and may continue to have on the Applicant, I determine that the Applicant's case should be adjudicated fully on the merits and not be prejudiced by its counsel's procedural fouls.
[175] In my view, these two new arguments have little merit. The flaw in both is the same: the Applicant's counsel assumes that CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy is operationalized by adopting relevant portions of the Terrestrial Code, leading to their conclusion that the Code's definitional distinctions between (a) "highly pathogenic" and "emerging" influenza and (b) "poultry" and "non-poultry" are what guide the CFIA in its implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy. This assumption is baseless. Canada's current domestic response to the avian flu is executed through the 2022 ERP. While the Terrestrial Code is an influential reference, it is not adopted by law or policy in its entirety and does not directly structure the CFIA's outbreak response.
[176] A quick review of the cross-examination transcript of Dr. Harchaoui shows that the Applicant's counsel should have known that their assumption is baseless:
Q. Now, did WOAH itself have any input in the creation of the policy?

Let me clarify. I know that there's the terrestrial animal health and it was a general policy, but was there any actual -- were there meetings with representatives or was there kind of a sample policy or anything like that that you adopted from WOAH?
A. So the role of WOAH is not to dictate any type of policy, but they have recommendations in their terrestrial code. One element where WOAH intervened, it was in the past through what we call

the PVS. It's the evaluation of the veterinary structure in any of the countries...
[emphasis added]
When reading this testimony alongside the 2022 ERP, there can be no doubt that the instrument operationalizing the Stamping-Out Policy and guiding the CFIA's decision-making process is the 2022 ERP, not the Terrestrial Code.
[177] A review of the relevant sections in the 2022 ERP confirms that the Policy applies to the Applicant's situation. Section 7.1 sets the trigger for confirmed case response as the confirmation that the sample yields a RRT-PCR H5 positive result for all cases that are not the first in that province. No further pathogenicity determination or "poultry" classification is required. Section 7.3 explicitly states:

The classification of an [infected premises] as non-poultry does not change the eradication actions required on the [infected premises]. These will be the same as for an [infected premises] classified as non-commercial (small-holding) poultry.
[emphasis added]
[178] Section 7.3 further clarifies that distinguishing poultry from non-poultry affects only international reporting and zoning calculations. It does not alter the core measures of depopulation, disposal, and disinfection. Accordingly, even if the ostriches were "non-poultry" or the virus could be characterized as an "emerging disease" pursuant to the Terrestrial Code, a confirmation of H5-positive RRT-PCR result would still unambiguously guide the CFIA to initiate the same response.

(2) The Notice to Dispose Withstands Judicial Scrutiny
(a) The Notice to Dispose was Issued in a Procedurally Fair Manner
[179] I find that the issuance of the Notice to Dispose did not breach procedural fairness. The duty of fairness the CFIA owed to the Applicant in issuing the Notice to Dispose lies on the lower end of the spectrum described in Baker. In the context of disease control, the urgency and emergency inherent to such situations justify a uniquely minimal duty of fairness that, as the Supreme Court recognized in Cardinal, may exclude prior notice or participatory rights. The CFIA's issuance of the Notice did not violate this minimal level of duty.
[180] The Applicant contends that the CFIA's issuance of the Notice to Dispose violated both the common law duty of procedural fairness and the Agency's own Open and Transparent Agency Policy [the Transparency Policy]. The Applicant highlights that the Transparency Policy commits the CFIA to "open-by-design" decision-making and timely release of information. In its view, the inspector who issued the Notice, fell short of that commitment by offering no explanation beyond checking statutory boxes on the form. On this footing, the Applicant submits that the applicable duty of fairness was moderate to robust, requiring a more participatory process before subsection 48(1) of the Act was invoked and the Stamping-Out Policy applied. In particular, the Applicant argues that fairness entitled it to an advance notice of the decision, disclosure of relevant materials, and more extensive participatory opportunities in reviewing and contesting the laboratory results, proposing alternative mitigation strategies such as selective culling, vaccination, or burn-out, submitting evidence of the flock's natural immunity, and receiving more detailed reasons than those provided in the standard-form Notice.

[181] The Respondent submits that, at the initial notice stage of this multi-step administrative process, the duty of procedural fairness is minimal, if it exists at all. In its view, the Notice to Dispose constitutes a mechanical implementation of a standing emergency policy, involving little to no discretionary judgment and therefore attracting a very low fairness threshold. On the Transparency Policy, the Respondent argues it is aspirational and non-binding. Even so, it maintains that real-time disclosure of evolving emergency-response data and documents during an active investigation is neither practical nor required. In the Respondent's view, the only procedural requirement at this stage, particularly given the urgency inherent in disease-control decisions, is to issue a subsection 48(3) compliant notice that sets out the legal basis and substantive instructions for disposal without the need for prior notice or participatory opportunities. According to the Respondent, requiring advance notice or adversarial participation before issuing the Notice would frustrate the statutory purpose of enabling rapid containment of serious disease threats.
[182] Applying the factors outlined in Baker at paragraphs 23 and 27, I find that the procedural fairness does exist at this stage of the multi-step decision-making process, but it lies on the lower end of the spectrum. First, as the Respondent correctly observes, the issuance of a Notice to Dispose is a largely mechanical act guided by clear triggering criteria and procedural steps outlined in the 2022 ERP. It is further removed from a judicial model of decision-making and involves limited discretion on the part of individual inspectors. As this Court recently reaffirmed, the narrower the discretion is afforded to the decision-maker, the lower the level of procedural fairness is required: Osakwe v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 CanLII 111754 (FC) at para 9.

[183] Second, the Notice to Dispose does not represent a final determination of the Applicant's legal rights or entitlements. The Stamping-Out Policy contemplates an immediate follow-up opportunity to apply for an exemption, which the CFIA promptly extended to the Applicant. The existence of this subsequent participatory opportunity within the broader process supports the conclusion that a lower level of fairness is owed at this initial stage.
[184] Third, issuing the Notice to Dispose undoubtedly carries significant adverse consequences for the Applicant. The ostrich operation appears to be the entirety, or at the very least the core, of the Applicant's business, and the principals have devoted considerable time, financial resources, and labour into developing the flock. A full depopulation of the farm will seriously disrupt the Applicant's business operation, producing a long-lasting, if not permanent, economic consequence. Although the Applicant may be entitled to some compensation under the Compensation Regulations, the extent and sufficiency of this relief is disputed. In all, the magnitude and irreversibility of the impact raises the level of procedural fairness owed in this case.
[185] Fourth, as discussed in the Legal Framework section, Parliament has delegated broad discretionary power to the Minister and their delegates under section 48 of the Act. It has prescribed only minimal procedural entitlements with the requirement to issue notices pursuant to subsection 48(3). While I agree with the Respondent that the CFIA's Transparency Policy is not legally binding, I do not accept that it is irrelevant to the procedural fairness analysis. The Supreme Court in Baker has made clear that reviewing courts should "take into account and respect the choices of procedure made by the agency," especially when "the agency has an expertise in determining what procedures are appropriate in the circumstances": Baker at

para 27. However, the Transparency Policy sets out only broad aspirational principles and offers no concrete procedural directives applicable to the implementation of the Stamping-Out Policy. For instance, its commitment to "open-by-design" provides general value statements rather offering concrete procedural measures. As such, it cannot represent a deliberate procedural choice made by the CFIA in the way that the 2022 ERP and the What to Expect - Steps on How CFIA Will Work Through the Process on Your Farm document do, neither of which contemplate document disclosure or participatory elements at this stage of the administrative process. Hence, this factor also supports a lower duty of fairness.
[186] Weighing these factors cumulatively, I determine that the overall procedural fairness owed to the Applicant is minimal. In fact, this very limited duty of fairness applicable here does not require either prior notice or participatory rights before the issuance of the Notice to Dispose, nor does it demand detailed substantive reasons. As the Respondent rightly notes, the Supreme Court has established in Cardinal at paragraphs 15 and 16 that even where a duty of fairness exists, urgent or emergency situations may mean that the duty of fairness involves no requirement for notice or participation before the decision. This is precisely the scenario Parliament anticipated the Minister and their delegates, including the CFIA, would encounter in daily operations, and accordingly enacted sections 22 and 48 of the Act to authorize immediate action based on mere "suspicion" of a reportable disease to achieve rapid and proactive disease mitigation and prevention. On this uniquely minimal standard, I find that the CFIA met its procedural obligations. Before issuing the Notice, Agency officials had communicated with the Applicant and conducted an on-site inspection. These interactions informed the Applicant of the essential basis for the Agency's action and gave its principals an opportunity to comment on

sampling logistics and demonstrate biosafety conditions. No further advance notice, participation, or detailed reasons were legally required.
[187] The issuance of the Notice to Dispose itself also properly complied with subsection 48(3) of the Act. The Notice, delivered on December 31, 2024, cited subsection 48(1) as the legal authority, ordered the destruction of all birds within the defined epidemiological unit, outlined the procedures for carcass disposal, and set a compliance deadline of February 1, 2025.
[188] Because the CFIA had discharged the procedural obligations applicable at this initial stage of an extended decision-making process, the Applicant's challenge to the Notice to Dispose on procedural fairness grounds cannot succeed.
(b) The Notice to Dispose was Unfettered
[189] I find that Inspector Zhang was unfettered in making the decision to issue the Notice to Dispose. As explained in the Legal Framework section, fettering is only a concern when the decision-maker wields discretion in making the decision. In my view, the 2022 ERP has structured the CFIA's statutory discretion into a multi-step process where issuing the Notice becomes a non-discretionary action following H5-positive detection through RRT-PCR. The discretionary element is reserved exclusively for the exemption evaluation step. Since Inspector Zhang had no discretion to exercise at the Notice issuance stage, he could not have been fettered in his decision-making.
[190] The Applicant argues that section 48 of the Act expressly permits treatment as an alternative to destruction, which the CFIA has not seriously pursued. According to the

Applicant, the CFIA expressly refused even to consider options such as selective depopulation, sentinel surveillance, vaccination trials or permitting naturally immune birds to remain on-site, which are approaches the Applicant's experts characterize as feasible for low-density, long-lived ostriches. In the Applicant's view, by slavishly mirroring non-binding WOAH guidance aimed mostly at avian species that do not resemble ostriches, Inspector Zhang, and by extension the Agency, was fettered by the Stamping-Out Policy.
[191] I am not persuaded. To begin, the Applicant's argument again falsely equates WOAH policies with the Stamping-Out Policy. The operative instrument that implements the Policy is the 2022 ERP. If any fettering were to be found, it would need to be traced to that document. Yet, a reading of the 2022 ERP shows that the "case response trigger" stage functions in a mechanical manner: once an accredited laboratory confirms a positive H5 RRT-PCR result on a premises that is not the provincial index case, the issuance of a Notice to Dispose proceeds almost automatically.
[192] While this may, at first glance, appear to reflect the textbook definition of fettering, where a decision-maker applies a policy as legally binding without considering whether deviation is possible, such a conclusion does not withstand closer examination. The Applicant's submission that subsection 48(1) of the Act contemplates treatment and therefore requires the inspector to weigh alternative approaches ignores how the statutory discretion has been legitimately structured by the 2022 ERP. Although subsection 48(1) does indeed vest broad discretion in the Minister and their delegates, the CFIA has operationalized that discretion by allocating it unevenly across different stages of the 2022 ERP. As recognized in Thamotharem and Ainsley, such allocation is lawful, so long as the total discretion of the entire process is not

diminished. Here, the discretion is concentrated at the exemption stage, where CFIA officials evaluate case-specific facts and weigh multiple policy and scientific considerations in deciding whether to exempt an applicant from depopulation. Viewed holistically, the overall statutory discretion remains intact. It is not abolished, merely channelled. That allocation is operationally sensible given the urgency and importance of HPAI responses, and finds support in Carpenter Fishing, the David Hunt cases, and Kohl. Given that such allocation of discretion among different decision points in a multi-step administrative process is permissible in law, the lack of discretion in the issuance of the Notice to Dispose is legal. Consequently, because no discretion exists at this step, nothing can be unlawfully constrained.
[193] Accordingly, the fettering claim fails. The jurisprudence and statute permit the CFIA to channel discretion through a policy of general application. The 2022 ERP has done exactly that by allocating where that discretion is to be exercised based on the real urgency of disease-control and Inspector Zhang, having no discretion at the trigger stage, could not possibly have abdicated or fettered it.

# (c) The Notice to Dispose was Reasonable 

[194] I find that Inspector Zhang's decision to issue the Notice to Dispose was reasonable. He acted within the scope of his designated responsibilities in the broader disease-control process: not as an independent assessor of potential alternatives, but as an implementer of the StampingOut Policy as structured through the 2022 ERP. At the stage of issuing the Notice, his role did not require individualized deliberation over alternative disease-management strategies, as those policy determinations had already been made upstream in the policymaking process. I also reject the Applicant's "common sense" argument that Inspector Zhang should have awaited further

confirmatory testing and weighed alternative options before acting. This submission is rhetorical, unsupported by evidence, and ignores the specialized nature of disease-control decision-making. What the Applicant portrays as "common sense" is not some self-evident truth but rather a policy preference masquerading as intuitive reasoning. This Court cannot replace science-based, expertise-driven judgments with counsel's appeals to lay intuition, particularly in a domain involving the management of potentially serious and fast-evolving animal and public health risk.
[195] In challenging the reasonableness of the Notice to Dispose, the Applicant advances two primary arguments. The first closely mirrors its earlier submissions on fettering and takes issue with Inspector Zhang's decision to issue the Notice without considering alternatives to the Stamping-Out Policy. Framed within the reasonableness inquiry, the Applicant characterizes this as a failure to consider relevant evidence, such as the potential benefits and efficacy of selective depopulation, quarantine and surveillance, and vaccination treatments. The Applicant argues that this omission contravenes the requirement articulated in paragraph 126 of Vavilov, which obliges administrative decision-makers to engage with relevant evidence before them.
[196] The second, closely related argument was raised during oral submissions. It concerns whether Inspector Zhang acted unreasonably by issuing the Notice to Dispose without deliberating other options and awaiting confirmatory testing from the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg. According to the Applicant's counsel, proceeding in the absence of such deliberation and confirmation defied common sense. Faced with a novel or potentially altered pathogen, counsel argued, commonsense prudence demands that sufficient information be gathered and alterative routes be considered before issuing a consequential

decision like the Notice to Dispose. Acting in the absence of such information and deliberation, counsel asserted, reflected hasty decision-making driven by a lack of common sense. This, in turn, undermined the internal coherence of Inspector Zhang's reasoning and rendered the decision unreasonable: Vavilov at paras 102-104.
[197] I do not find either argument persuasive. Regarding the first claim that the decisionmaker failed to consider all relevant evidence, I reject it for reasons similar to why I found the fettering argument unconvincing. As outlined in the Legal Framework section and discussed in the fettering analysis, Inspector Zhang's role within the broader disease-control process was not to independently assess the situation, but to implement the Stamping-Out Policy as operationalized through the 2022 ERP. His actions were governed by a decision-making framework that has been long adopted and developed by the CFIA pursuant to its statutory authority under section 48 of the Act. As I have already found the Stamping-Out Policy reasonable in its design, which does not require case-specific deliberation at the stage of issuing a Notice to Dispose, there is nothing unreasonable in Inspector Zhang's execution of the framework as provided.
[198] Even assuming that Inspector Zhang was required to exercise independent judgment based on the information available to him, I am not persuaded that he overlooked any relevant evidence that was before him. First, the material before Inspector Zhang did not include the alternative disease-control strategies now advanced by the Applicant. As outlined in the Overview, judicial review is confined to the record that was before the decision-maker at the time of the decision. As the Respondent correctly submits, the record before the Inspector consisted of the 2022 ERP, laboratory test results confirming that the Applicant's ostrich herd

was positive for H5 via RRT-PCR, and information obtained by the CFIA during phone communications and an on-site inspection regarding the biosecurity practices at the premises.
[199] Given this evidentiary context, I agree with the Respondent that the Inspector's brief written reasons, when read together with the surrounding record, provide a justification that meets the standard of reasonableness. As Vavilov explains at paragraph 97, citing Komolafe $v$ Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 431 at para 11, even where formal reasons are limited or absent, reviewing courts may connect the "dots on the page" if the record and outcome clearly suggest the underlying rationale. In this case, those dots are especially clear and easily connectable, given the nature of disease-control decision-making where officials are often required to act swiftly and decisively in response to rapidly evolving and potentially catastrophic threats.
[200] Even if the alternative strategies proposed by the Applicant were available to Inspector Zhang at the relevant time, I would still find no basis to conclude that his decision to issue the Notice to Dispose was unreasonable. My exploration of the pertinent statutory and regulatory framework in the Legal Framework section demonstrates that the scheme under section 48 of the Act outlines a functional binary of destruction and treatment, and treatment refers only to measures the Minister and their delegates deem "effective in eliminating or preventing the spread of the disease or toxic substance." The legislative scheme does not contemplate a third "wait-and-see" option. Accordingly, if the Minister's delegates like Inspector Zhang do not consider a proposed treatment effective, destruction is the only reasonable route prescribed by the statute.

[201] Here, Inspector Zhang opted for destruction, indicating that he did not consider the alternative measures sufficient to prevent the spread of or eliminate the disease. That determination rests on making scientific and technical judgments, tasks Parliament has entrusted to CFIA officials like Inspector Zhang. It is not the function of this Court to doubt the scientific merits of such expert assessments, particularly in the context of infectious disease-control where decisions often must be made quickly and decisively in the face of uncertainty.
[202] Concerning the "common sense" submission advanced by the Applicant's counsel at the hearing, I find it to be rhetorical in nature, unsupported by evidence, and unhelpful to this Court's analysis. Common sense arguments have their time and place. The Supreme Court has repeatedly acknowledged that judicial reasoning and fact-finding may necessarily require common sense and lived experience. For instance, as observed in paragraph 39 of R. v S. (R.D.), [1997] 3 SCR 484, "the trier of fact is entitled simply to apply common sense and human experience in determining whether evidence is credible and in deciding what use, if any, to make of it in coming to its finding of fact."
[203] However, common sense is also a concept that is too often misused both in and outside of the courtroom. Sound commonsense reasoning must be sufficiently supported by the evidence and appropriately responsive to the context in which the decision is made. It cannot rest on pure speculation or assumption, especially in decision-making contexts that are not at all common in an ordinary person's lived experience. Indeed, the Supreme Court has recently cautioned against making common sense "a catch-all phrase that licenses any form of reasoning, no matter how faulty," since it "is not always 'common', does not always make 'sense', and worst of all, may be based on falsehoods or discriminatory beliefs": R. v. Kruk, 2024 SCC 7 at para 99.

[204] With respect, the invocation of "common sense" reasoning in the present case reveals a fundamental misunderstanding, or neglect, of the complexities involved in scientific and technical decision-making performed by the Agency. What the Applicant's counsel characterizes as "common sense," the idea that Inspector Zhang, and by extension the CFIA, should have waited for confirmatory testing before acting, is a policy preference masquerading as self-evident truth. It presupposes that the "wait-and-see" strategies proposed by the Applicant are inherently the more rational or common choices when facing a rapidly spreading disease with unknown attributes that was actively killing the Applicant's ostriches. Even setting aside the fact that established epidemiological protocols such as the ERP 2022 often dictate precisely the opposite, I am not convinced that reasonable individuals without specialized training in virology, epidemiology, or public health would instinctively view a "wait-and-see" approach as the commonsense response to such a pathogen.
[205] Moreover, as explained, common sense in decision-making only becomes truly "common" and "sensible" when ordinary individuals are familiar with or routinely exposed to the type of decision being made. That is not the case here. The complex, science-driven, and high-stakes decisions involved in managing the spread of avian influenza fall well outside the realm of commonly shared lived experience. To be clear, I do not suggest that the course of action proposed by the Applicant's counsel is inherently wrong or unworthy of consideration. I merely observe that it is not as self-evidently "common" or "sensible" as counsel suggest.
[206] What concerns me more is the "common sense" reasoning proposed by counsel seems to suggest, without any support, that there exists a universal layperson standard of rational decisionmaking in disease-control that should override the need for specialized expertise. As I have

repeatedly emphasized throughout my reasons, this Court cannot replace the technical judgment of officials, nor accept counsel's rhetorical appeals to intuition, in place of the expertise exercised within a well-established policy framework for managing potential disease outbreaks that carry significant implications for public and animal health across Canada. Indeed, the Supreme Court in paragraph 93 of Vavilov expressly cautioned against such an approach:

Respectful attention to a decision maker's demonstrated expertise may reveal to a reviewing court that an outcome that might be puzzling or counterintuitive on its face nevertheless accords with the purposes and practical realities of the relevant administrative regime and represents a reasonable approach given the consequences and the operational impact of the decision. This demonstrated experience and expertise may also explain why a given issue is treated in less detail.
[207] Considering the facts and law before me, I conclude that the "common sense" argument is rhetorical in nature and not suitably responsive to the scientific and institutional context in which the CFIA operates. Inspector Zhang's issuance of the Notice to Dispose does not suffer from such a defect and therefore must stand.
(3) The Exemption Denial Withstands Judicial Scrutiny
(a) The Exemption Denial was Issued in a Procedurally Fair Manner
[208] I conclude that the CFIA has fulfilled the high level of duty of fairness it owed to the Applicant in the exemption evaluation process. The Applicant asserts that it held a legitimate expectation of outcome, but in law such expectation cannot give rise to substantive rights. Even when viewed from a procedural perspective, no legitimate expectation could have arisen because the CFIA never made any clear, unambiguous, or unqualified representations about procedure to the Applicant. The Applicant further did not suffer unfairness from the claimed disclosure defects, as the "significant burden of proof" language in the final decision merely restated the

consistently communicated evidentiary threshold, and all material content from the Exemptions from depopulation appendix relevant to the Applicant's situation had already been provided. Throughout the eight-day evaluation process, CFIA officials engaged extensively with the Applicant, emphasizing the specific documentation requirements and the urgency of the process. I am convinced that the process left the Applicant with full awareness of the case it needed to meet and adequate opportunities to do so.
[209] The Applicant submits that a high level of fairness applied to the CFIA's exemption evaluation process. Unlike the effectively automatic issuance of a Notice to Dispose, the exemption decision was discretionary and, importantly, expressly contemplated participatory opportunities under the 2022 ERP. The Applicant argues that the duty was further heightened considering the gravity of the Exemption Denial's consequences: the decision has effectively sealed the fate of some 400 ostriches, threatened the livelihoods of the principals, and jeopardized ongoing antibody research projects.
[210] The Applicant contends that this high standard of fairness was breached in two main ways. First, it argues that it had a legitimate expectation that the exemption would either be granted or, at the very least, seriously considered in a flexible and open-ended manner. This expectation, according to the Applicant, was grounded in the Exemption Process Overview Email sent by the Case Officer on January 2, 2025, which the Applicant interpreted as indicating that its ostriches had already been accepted into a specific procedure that led toward the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption, and that the evaluative process was an open-ended one. The Applicant says that such impression was further reinforced during a meeting on the next day, when, in response to a question from one of the principals about whether the ostriches would be

culled, the Case Officer reportedly stated that the Agency "would have told UOF at the outset of the meeting if they had made that decision." From the Applicant's perspective, these interactions had established a legitimate expectation for a favourable outcome:
...in [Case Officer's January 2, 2025] email it seemed to us that CFIA had already placed the UOF's ostriches into the "bird classified as having rare and valuable genetics" category. We were just told to send in some documents to show what we had been doing.

The Applicant asserts that this legitimate expectation was breached when: 1) the Agency unilaterally shifted from an open-ended process to a narrow one requiring specific documentation, without notice; and 2) the Agency imposed a brand new "significant burden of proof" standard, which was only disclosed to the Applicant in the Exemption Denial decision itself, and thus constituted an unannounced deviation from the procedure that the Applicant expected.
[211] Second, the Applicant argues that the CFIA's failure to make necessary disclosures prevented it from knowing the case it had to meet. Specifically, the Applicant takes issue with two items that were not provided: 1) the evidentiary standard of "significant burden of proof;" and 2) the Exemptions from depopulation appendix to the 2022 ERP, which outlines and explains the exemption criteria. The Applicant contends that, without being informed of the applicable evidentiary threshold and exemption criteria, it did not know the case it had to meet and was unable to properly prepare its case. As a result, it did not gather or submit expert opinions, genetic data, or business documentation that it otherwise would have provided to meet the standard. The Applicant further submits that these disclosure failures were aggravated by the

CFIA's breach of its own Transparency Policy, which commits to the timely provision of relevant information.
[212] The Respondent does not dispute the level of duty owed to the Applicant, but maintains that the process was fair, and in any event, no additional procedural safeguards could have changed the outcome. In its view, the Exemption Process Overview Email from the Case Officer, when appropriately examined in context, clearly sets out the case the Applicant needed to meet. The email described upfront that the process was "document heavy," explained in detail the "rare and valuable genetics" exemption category, and included the Distinct Unit Request Package, which detailed the relevant exemption criteria and provided a self-reporting checklist for biosafety measures. The email also instructed the Applicant to submit "documented proof" of distinct genetics and gave specific examples of acceptable evidence, such as historical breeding records, genomic testing results, or third-party valuations. According to the Respondent, the Applicant failed to provide any of the requested documentation and, in completing the Distinct Unit Request Package, answered "no" to 13 of the 20 biosecurity-related self-reporting questions that would support a finding of distinct epidemiological status. As such, the Respondent argues that the refusal should not have come as a surprise and confirms that the process was fair.
[213] The Respondent also denies that any new standard was introduced. The use of the phrase "significant burden of proof" in the written decision, it argues, simply reiterated what the term "documented proof" had already conveyed. It was not an unexpected or new evidentiary threshold introduced at the last moment, especially given the repeated detailed list of sample

documents and the detailed explanation of the exemption process set out in the Distinct Unit Request Package.
[214] The Respondent further rejects the notion that the Transparency Policy or staff communications created enforceable procedural rights. According to the Respondent, a general transparency commitment cannot give rise to binding obligations, and no applicant can reasonably expect a particular procedure or favourable decision based solely on general assurances without clear operational promises. Legitimate expectations, it argues, concern procedural fairness, not the outcome itself.
[215] Lastly, the Respondent contends that even if there had been a procedural shortcoming, such as a failure to disclose all documentation in advance, it would not have affected the result. The record shows that every ostrich in the flock had shared the same exposure risk, and under the 2022 ERP and its appendix Exemptions from depopulation, no flock in such circumstances could qualify as a distinct epidemiological unit.
[216] I agree with the Applicant that the procedural fairness owed here is high for the factors it has listed: an inherently discretionary process, the contemplation of participatory elements, and the serious impact of the decision on the Applicant. However, I reject the Applicant's claim that the CFIA breached this heightened duty.
[217] The Applicant's first claim of fairness breach is unpersuasive, because its position on legitimate expectation lacks legal foundation and factual support. It is trite law that legitimate expectations cannot give rise to substantive entitlements or outcomes: JP Morgan at para 75;

Jennings-Clyde at para 40. If the Applicant's counsel erred in submission and instead intended to assert a procedural legitimate expectation, I nevertheless find no basis for it. The Exemption Process Overview Email from the Case Officer does not contain any representation capable of generating a procedural expectation.
[218] To ground a legitimate expectation, the Applicant must show that the Agency made a clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representation as to the procedure it would follow, or that it has consistently adopted a particular procedural practice in similar contexts: Mavi at para 68. The Applicant relies on the former basis and builds its arguments primarily upon two sentences from the Exemption Process Overview Email. The first sentence reads: "Based on the information we've gathered, you fall into the 'birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics' category." The Applicant asserts that this is a clear confirmation from the CFIA that its ostriches had been locked into the procedure leading to exemption based on "rare and valuable genetics." Even when read in isolation, this statement does not rise to the level of a clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representation about the procedure the CFIA would follow. At best, and even under the most generous interpretation, it is only suggesting that, based on the information available at that time, the Applicant might be eligible for consideration under that category.
[219] When viewed in context, there should be no reasonable doubt left about what the Case Officer meant by this sentence, that the Applicant's exemption request, based on the CFIA's understanding of the preliminary information it has gathered, falls into the "rare and valuable genetics" category, and to fully qualify for the exemption the Applicant needed to provide the

requested information to support its case. Two contextual clues are especially illuminating. The first one comes within the Email itself:

Here's what we need from you at this time to get started:

- We need documented proof that these birds are distinctive from standard commercial flocks. The highlighted section above gives good examples of the types of documents we're looking for.

I find the phrases "to get started" and "we need documented proof" both convey that the process was at a preliminary stage and exemption was conditional on the Applicant's provision of specific supporting materials. The reference of "to get started" expressly signals that the evaluation process had not yet concluded, while the request for "documented proof" reveals that the burden was on the Applicant to substantiate its exemption claim. Given this analysis, CFIA officials' statement that they "would have told UOF at the outset of the meeting if they had made that decision" also clearly indicates that the Agency was still in the process of gathering information and had not yet reached a conclusion, rather than that the exemption approval was forthcoming or that the process would be open-ended. The language used in the email or at the meeting does not support any inference that the CFIA had already committed the Applicant's exemption application to a specific procedural route.
[220] The second contextual clue is found in the phone log documenting the Case Officer's first interaction with the Applicant's principals, some four hours before the Exemption Process Overview Email was sent. That log contains a key portion that describes how the Case Officer briefed the principals on the exemption process:

It was indicated December 31, 2024, after CFIA informed
Mr. [Principal] of the positive Avian Influenza (AI) test
result that Mr. [Principal] was interested in a [sic]
exemption from depopulation for his ostriches. $\underline{\text { CO... }}$

briefed Mr. [Principal] on the process, that a Distinct Unit Request (DUR) would have to be submitted to CFIA to start the process. Mr. [Principal] requested his business partner... to be in the call and a three-way phone call was started to include Mrs. [Principal]... CO... further explained that the DUR process is very time sensitive and document heavy, stressed the importance of submitting everything to CFIA in time and would further explain in an email and attach the DUR template.
[emphasis added]

The underlined parts directly undermine the Applicant's argument. First, the Case Officer explicitly explained to the Applicant's principals that a "Distinct Unit Request... would have to be submitted to CFIA to start the process." This alone dispels any notion that, at the time the Exemption Process Overview Email was received, the process had been set on a procedural track leading toward exemption, because that very Email was the one that provided the Distinct Unit Request Package necessary to initiate the process. Second, the Case Officer emphasized to the principals that the exemption process would be "very time sensitive and document heavy," stressing the importance of "submitting everything to CFIA in time." This unequivocally conveyed the provisional and conditional nature of the exemption process, reinforcing that the responsibility to meet the requirements rested with the Applicant. These statements cannot reasonably be interpreted as creating an expectation of the procedure sought by the Applicant.
[221] Viewed alone or collectively, these two contextual clues put to rest any dispute that a legitimate expectation could somehow have arisen from this: "Based on the information we've gathered, you fall into the 'birds classified as having rare and valuable genetics' category."
[222] The second sentence relied on by the Applicant to assert its legitimate expectation claim that the evaluative process was promised to be an open-ended one: "The Exemption Email went

on to state that ' $[t]$ he genetics of the flock can be demonstrated to be distinctive from standard commercial flocks with criteria such as but not limited to the following...'" [italics in the original; emphasis added by the Applicant]. However, apart from doing underlining, the Applicant has offered no explanation, either in written or oral submissions, on how this sentence establishes a procedural commitment to an open-ended procedure.
[223] With respect, I am of the view that, again, when properly read in context, this sentence conveys precisely the opposite of what the Applicant suggests. The relevant excerpt from the Email reads:

The genetics of the flock can be demonstrated to be distinctive from standard commercial flocks with criteria such as but not limited to the following:

- There is historical evidence of genetic investment...;
- The flock consists of high quality pure-bred birds...;
- Genomics testing for specific traits has been undertaken

Here's what we need from you at this time to get started:

- We need documented proof that these birds are distinctive from standard commercial flocks. The highlighted section above gives good examples of the types of documents we're looking for.
- If you have any documentation of the agreement between you and the university - that'd be really helpful to send to us.
[emphasis added]
The language "The highlighted section above gives good examples of the types of documents we're looking for" links the request for documentation directly to the previously listed criteria. This indicates that while the Applicant's underlined "with criteria such as but not limited" signals that the list is not strictly exhaustive, it does not support the Applicant's interpretation of

an open-ended process in which its submitted documents will be sufficiently probative. Rather, it clarifies that the CFIA was seeking materials of a comparable nature and probative value, which are documents capable of substantiating the distinctive genetic characteristics of the flock. Similarly, the request for "any documentation of the agreement between you and the university that'd be really helpful to send to us" points to the Agency's interest in targeted, relevant information, not an invitation for the Applicant to define the expected procedure and submit evidence according to its wants and wishes. These communications reflect a structured procedural framework, not an undefined or open-ended process.
[224] Beyond the Email's plain language, other contextual indicators further undermine the Applicant's interpretation. The exemption application required completion of a self-reporting form with predefined criteria, and the Case Officer repeatedly requested specific documents, including those supporting the Applicant's alleged collaboration with Kyoto University and evidence of the flock's purportedly unique genetic profile. Additionally, the What to Expect Steps on How CFIA Will Work Through the Process on Your Farm document attached to the Process Introduction Email overwhelmingly reinforces this conclusion. Although the document acknowledges some "fluidity" in terms of overlapping of procedural steps, it lays out clear, defined, and sequential steps in the overarching administrative process. Taken together, these materials show that the exemption process was tightly structured and driven by specific criteria, not open-ended as the Applicant suggests.
[225] The Applicant's second claim of fairness breach is also unconvincing, because its submissions on disclosure defects are misguided. Regarding the alleged omission of the "significant burden of proof" that was ultimately imposed on the Applicant and, it says, resulted

in its inability to meet the case because it had no knowledge of the case it had to meet, I find it to be mostly a claim that plays on semantics. While there is no doubt that the exact wording of "significant burden of proof" only appeared for the first time in the Exemption Denial, they add no substantive hurdle beyond what the Applicant had already been told from January 2, 2025 and onwards.
[226] The Exemption Process Overview Email warned that an exemption request is "document heavy" and must include documented proof that the birds are genetically distinct. The attached Distinct Unit Request Package stated only "in some exceptional circumstances, a distinct population of birds may be recognized," and explained the CFIA may exercise its discretion to exempt it from depopulation. It also warned "any 'no' responses" to the twenty self-reporting biosecurity questions "will likely result in a denial of the request."
[227] The CFIA's subsequent communications made it even more evident that the Applicant was or should have been aware of the high evidentiary threshold it needed to meet. Over eight days, CFIA officials held virtual meetings and made phone calls to discuss the situation with the Applicant, conducted another on-farm assessment, answered questions about completing the package, and repeatedly urged the owners to supply "as much supporting evidence as possible." These interactions emphasized the need for specific kinds of documentation and made it clear that a heavy evidentiary burden rested on the Applicant.
[228] In my view, both the plain language of the Exemption Process Overview Email and the surrounding contextual communications made it sufficiently clear that the Applicant bore a substantial onus to present persuasive documentation aligned with the exemption criteria. The

phrase "significant burden of proof," as used in the Exemption Denial, simply restated that existing and obvious obligation in more concise terms. While I acknowledge that the CFIA could have provided greater clarity by using that exact wording from the outset, I do not find the Agency's later use of this language introduced or imposed a new, higher evidentiary threshold that would amount to a breach of procedural fairness.
[229] The Applicant's second claim of disclosure failure is similarly unconvincing, because the alleged failure neither was an actual failure nor prevented the Applicant from understanding the case it needed to meet. I find it puzzling why the Applicant insists that it was entitled to receive the full Exemptions from depopulation appendix, when all content relevant and material to its exemption request from that appendix had already been conveyed through the Exemption Process Overview Email.
[230] Two examples suffice to illustrate this point. First, the Exemption Process Overview Email reproduced in full the key part of the appendix concerning the "rare and valuable genetics" category of exemption, which was the very category that the Applicant expressed interest in pursuing and did pursue. Second, the attached Distinct Unit Request Package clearly outlined the criteria for establishing a distinct epidemiological unit. In fact, together, these two sources provided the entirety of the core requirements that the Applicant needed to satisfy to obtain an exemption: the threshold of distinct epidemiological units and the documentary evidence necessary to support a claim under the rare genetics category.
[231] Apart from the already addressed argument regarding the "significant burden of proof," the Applicant has identified no specific omission in the material disclosed to it that impaired its

ability to make its case. At the hearing and in its written submissions, it failed to point to any particular section or passage from the Exemptions from depopulation appendix that was relied upon in the exemption evaluation process but was withheld from it. Instead, the Applicant simply asserts in broad terms that the entire appendix should have been disclosed. The Applicant does cite again the Transparency Policy in support of this argument. But, as explained above, the Transparency Policy is aspirational in nature and contains no specific procedural commitments relevant to the administration of exemptions under the Stamping-Out Policy. It does not entitle the Applicant to receive internal policy guidelines in full, especially where the CFIA has already disclosed the material operative criteria and evidentiary expectations relevant to the request at hand.
(b) The Exemption Denial was Reasonable
[232] I find that the CFIA's Exemption Denial was reasonable. Most of the Applicant's arguments on Exemption Denial are more accurately understood as challenges to the reasonableness of the Stamping-Out Policy and have therefore already been addressed in my above analysis on the Policy's reasonableness. Accordingly, I have consolidated the remaining relevant objections and distilled them into three arguments that directly concern the reasonableness of the Exemption Denial.
[233] First, the Applicant argues that the Exemption Denial was rendered when a pivotal piece of scientific input was still outstanding. This evidence was Dr. French's rapid literature review on avian influenza in ostriches, which the Exemption Committee had itself commissioned on the morning of January 10, 2025. The Applicant notes that the Agency asked for this review because it acknowledged that the Stamping-Out Policy had primarily been developed based on

experience with chickens and turkeys, not ostriches. Yet, the Exemption Denial was finalized and sent roughly five hours before Dr. French submitted her report. The Applicant contends that the Committee's failure to wait even just one day for the results of a report it had commissioned and acknowledged as important constitutes a fatal flaw. In its view, by proceeding without this key scientific input, the Exemption Committee acted on an incomplete record and thereby reached an unreasonable decision.
[234] Second, the Applicant submits that the Exemption Committee misconstrued its own exemption framework by improperly welding together the two distinct exemption pathways of "rare and valuable genetics" and "distinct unit." According to the Applicant, the Agency's internal Decision Record titled Updates to Distinct Unit Recognition Process lists these as separate, disjunctive categories for exemptions. The Exemption Denial, however, treated "distinct unit" status as a pre-requisite to the genetics exemption and rejected the request on the basis that there was no physically and epidemiologically segregated subgroup. The Applicant contends that this conflation led the Committee to apply the policy incorrectly, making the Exemption Denial unreasonable.
[235] Third, the Applicant contends that the Exemption Committee failed to consider relevant evidence that bears on its decision. This evidentiary neglect manifested in two major ways. First, the Committee ignored operation-specific factors that distinguished the Applicant's situation from other more common poultry farms: the ostriches' documented natural immunity following recovery from a 2020 "flu-like" illness; their uniquely long lifespan when compared to more common poultry; the relative difficulty of replacing ostriches once depopulated; the farm's isolation from other commercial poultry operations; a 30-year breeding program conferring

exceptional research value; and expert testimony that maintaining a naturally immune flock posed less risk than introducing new stock. Second, the Committee disregarded a central piece of contradictory evidence that undermined its trade-impact justification for rejecting exemption. Namely, that the granting of the March 2022 Exemption had caused no trade disruptions, suggesting that "evidently the exemption was not as impactful as" the Agency asserts. By selectively ignoring this evidence that directly challenged its reasoning, the Applicant argues, the Committee's decision is not justified considering the evidentiary record before them: Vavilov at para 126. For the Applicant, this neglect renders the Exemption Denial unreasonable.
[236] I will first explain, in turn, why I find each of the three arguments unpersuasive. Then, I will assess whether the CFIA's reasons for denying the exemption appropriately reflect the gravity of its decision on the Applicant. Although the Applicant did not advance a focused argument on this specific point, it repeatedly emphasized, in written and oral submissions, that the ordered depopulation could result in the operational collapse of the farm and significant financial hardship for its principals. Cognizant of the substantial consequences of the Exemption Denial and in keeping with Vavilov's instruction that administrative decisions must reflect the stakes of the decisions, I consider it this Court's obligation to examine whether the CFIA gave adequate consideration to those consequences in its reasoning.
(i) The Applicant's Argument on Dr. French's Rapid Literature Review Fails
[237] The Applicant's first argument is that the Exemption Denial was unreasonable because it was made without awaiting Dr. French's scientific inputs. I find, on close review, that this outstanding piece of information was not so essential to the CFIA's decision that proceeding without it rendered the decision unreasonable. I accept the Applicant's submission that the

Exemption Committee had not reviewed Dr. French's report at the time the Exemption Denial was issued. However, this omission is not the fatal flaw the Applicant makes it out to be.
[238] The record shows that the Exemption Committee properly set its central task as assessing whether any ostriches on the Applicant's premises met two criteria: 1) that they formed a distinct epidemiological unit; and 2) that they possessed "rare and valuable genetics" warranting preservation. Those twin criteria, laid out in the Distinct Unit Request Package and repeatedly explained to the Applicant's principals, turn on proper biosecurity practices, documentary pedigree and third-party recognition of genetic worth, rather than on a preliminary survey of avian influenza in ostriches. Indeed, the formal reasons for denial found both the Response Letter and the Internal Recommendation Memorandum show that the Committee focused primarily on the evidence directly relevant to those criteria: repeated on-site observations of wild bird and weasel ingresses into ostrich enclosures, the continued practice of shared feed sources, equipment, and personnel, the Applicant's predominantly negative responses to the twentyquestion biosecurity checklist, unrestricted human movement into areas designated as an Infected Place, and the absence of genomic testing or registry evidence demonstrating a unique and commercially valuable genetic line.
[239] With this gathered information, the Exemption Committee gave serious consideration to whether a subset of the Applicant's ostriches might be spared. However, after "significant debate," the Committee ultimately rejected this possibility. Their decision was driven by two key factors: the Applicant's poor biosecurity conditions and practices, and the lack of sufficient documentation to support the Applicant's claims regarding the genetic rarity and value of its ostriches. In that context, Dr. French's review-which found that ostriches are classified as

poultry under WOAH, that South Africa implements stamping-out measures for HPAI in ostriches, and that avian influenza can mutate spontaneously in ostriches to facilitate interspecies transmission-would have provided no evidence to contradict, let alone alter, the Committee's denial of exemption.
[240] Nor was the rapid literature review a necessary piece of science on ostriches for the Exemption Committee to make an informed decision. First, contrary to the Applicant's claim, its own cross-examination of Dr. Furness confirms that the Stamping-Out Policy was not designed solely for chickens or turkeys, but applies to "all avian species susceptible to highly pathogenic avian influenza, which includes ostriches and emus." This undermines the suggestion that the Agency lacked any foundational consideration of ostriches in its policy framework. Second, prior to issuing the Exemption Denial on January 10, 2025, the Committee had already consulted both internal experts and international counterparts, including officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's APHIS, on HPAI management in ostriches. All confirmed that the stamping-out approach continued to apply to ostriches without modification. In short, while Dr. French's report undoubtedly would have provided more extensive scientific understanding on the matter, the Committee did have access to current scientific and policy input on the issue and was not relying on an incomplete or outdated understanding.
[241] Even if I were to accept the Applicant's premise that Dr. French's rapid literature review was indispensable to the exemption assessment, the CFIA's decision would not be rendered unreasonable. If anything, it would be reinforced; that Dr. French's key conclusions, delivered later that evening, confirmed that ostriches are classified as poultry, that South Africa includes ostriches in its stamping-out approach, and that mutations of avian influenza in ostriches are

spontaneous and can increase interspecies transmissibility. Had the Committee waited, this information could only have further supported the decision to deny the exemption. Consistent with Vavilov's teaching that judicial review is not a "line-by-line treasure hunt for error," it would be unreasonable for this Court to fault the Agency for not waiting for a document that would have led to the same result, especially given the time-sensitive decision-making context within which it operates.
[242] With the above observations, I am satisfied that the CFIA's decision to deny the exemption was not unreasonable simply because it was rendered without examining the contents of Dr. French's rapid literature review. The Agency had done an extensive evidence-gathering process focusing on evidence going to the exemption criteria set out in the 2022 ERP, and then turned its attention to the evidence it had gathered and the Applicant had submitted. The Supreme Court instructs that decision-makers must meaningfully grapple with "key issues or central arguments raised by the parties," not pursue "every... line of possible analysis": Vavilov at para 128. Here, the CFIA had properly focused its assessment on the core issues: the ostriches' exposure to the virus, the Applicant's biosecurity conditions and practices, as well as the documentation of genetic rarity and value. These corresponded directly to the two criteria at the heart of the exemption request and engaged with the very evidence submitted by the Applicant. This demonstrates that the Agency was, in the language of Vavilov, "alert and sensitive to the matter before it." It was not required to delay its decision for a report that ultimately contributed no outcome-altering information. Instead, the Committee appropriately grappled with relevant and material evidence and submissions, striking the proper balance between decision-making thoroughness and administrative efficiency, as Vavilov envisions.

[243] The Applicant's assertion that the Exemption Committee was obliged to await Dr. French's literature review also fundamentally misunderstands how administrative agencies operate in time-sensitive and high-stakes decision-making contexts. This argument incorrectly assumes that information described as "important" and "informing the decision" becomes indispensable to a reasonable decision-making process. Agencies like the CFIA routinely draw on multiple sources to build as complete an understanding as possible within limited timeframes. Dr. Furness' acknowledgment during cross-examination that Dr. French's rapid review was "important" and would help inform the Exemption Denial does not make it a determinative piece of evidence. It was still one of many documents that may be "important" in building a better understanding without being decisive to the outcome. As the statutory authority entrusted by Parliament to handle the high-stakes role of animal disease-control, the CFIA has the expertise and discretion to determine when its evidentiary foundation is sufficient to justify acting.
[244] Therefore, although it may seem counterintuitive for the Exemption Committee to request a scientific review and then proceed without waiting even a single day for its completion, this course of action aligns with the practical reality and operational urgency of disease-control. As the Supreme Court emphasized at paragraph 93 of Vavilov, an administrative decision must be evaluated against specific purpose, context, and operational demands of the administrative regime, and what may seem puzzling in isolation often becomes reasonable when properly contextualized. On January 10, 2025, the date of the Exemption Denial, the Agency was managing an active outbreak of avian influenza at the Applicant's premises with ongoing ostrich deaths. Beyond commissioning Dr. French's rapid literature review, the Agency had already consulted internal experts and international counterparts, who all confirmed that stamping-out measures applied to ostriches, collected extensive on-site evidence of poor biosecurity, and

determined that the Applicant had failed to substantiate claims of genetic rarity or value. In this context, it was open to the CFIA to conclude that the Stamping-Out Policy needed to be implemented at the Applicant's premises, and thus the exemption request must be denied without further waiting.
[245] I repeat—judicial review must never be conducted with the benefit of hindsight. Although the infection had later abated with many ostriches surviving, that could not have been foreseen at the time. The Stamping-Out Policy guided the Agency to depopulate the entire exposed epidemiological unit without delay. In such circumstances, the Agency was entitled, indeed compelled by its statutory mandate under the Act, to act decisively once it had gathered sufficient information to make a sound determination. In my view, this approach of soliciting information from multiple sources and proceeding when receiving adequate rather than all solicited information reflects a demonstrated expertise of properly balancing thoroughness and urgency that characterizes effective disease control. Accordingly, I conclude that the Agency acted reasonably in finalizing the Exemption Denial when it did.
(ii) The Applicant's Argument on Conflation of Exemption Criteria Fails
[246] The Applicant's second argument is that the Exemption Denial was unreasonable because the Exemption Committee allegedly misread "rare and valuable genetics" and "distinct unit" as conjunctive requirements. I find the misunderstanding instead lies with the Applicant, not with the Committee. A brief review of the record clarifies this point.
[247] I agree with the Applicant that the 2022 ERP, its Exemptions from Depopulation appendix, and the Distinct Unit Request Package, shared with it via the Exemption Process

Overview Email, all list the "rare and valuable genetics" and "distinct unit" as separate, alternative exemption categories. However, the Exemption Committee never bolted these two categories together. Instead, the concepts the Committee paired in its reasons were "rare and valuable genetics" and distinct epidemiological unit. The Applicant's objection rests on a mix-up between "distinct unit," which is a standalone exemption category, and "distinct epidemiological unit," which is a threshold criterion applicable to all exemption requests.
[248] As I explained in the Legal Framework section, the exemption regime is clear that all three available exemption categories of "distinct unit," "rare and valuable genetics," and "pet birds" share the same initial threshold of demonstrating distinct epidemiological status. In fact, the very Decision Record the Applicant cites in support of its argument, Updates to Distinct Unit Recognition Process, explicitly confirms this common threshold:

1. Policy to be included as part of the ERP

In some exceptional circumstances, the CFIA may assess domestic birds on an [Infected Premise] to determine if they can be classified as a distinct epidemiological unit, and therefore not considered part of the susceptible population. Populations that are considered a distinct epidemiological unit may be exempt from depopulation.

There are three categories for the recognition of a distinct epidemiological unit:

- Distinct units
- Rare and valuable genetics
- Pet birds

Criteria for evaluation of each of the above categories is available in ERP Appendix - Exemptions from depopulation
[emphasis added]

[249] While the Applicant's confusion is not entirely unexpected given the similarity between "distinct unit" and "distinct epidemiological unit," any ambiguity should have been resolved by a review of the Distinct Unit Request Package provided to it. The cover page of that document clearly states: "If a group of birds are physically and functionally separate from the rest of an infected [epidemiological] unit, the CFIA may exercise its discretion to consider this group of birds as a distinct unit and exempt it from depopulation."
[250] Both the formal reasons set out in the Response Letter and the accompanying Internal Recommendation Memorandum demonstrate that the Exemption Committee applied the correct exemption criteria. The Committee first assessed whether any subgroup of the Applicant's flock qualified as a distinct epidemiological unit. Based on substantial evidence of inadequate biosecurity at the Applicant's facility, it reasonably concluded that none did. Since demonstrating distinct epidemiological status is a threshold requirement for all exemption categories, that finding alone was sufficient to justify denying the application. The Committee's additional analysis of "rare and valuable genetics" were supplementary comments, or justification in the alternative, not a sign of an analysis that conflated criteria.
[251] In any event, even if the "rare and valuable genetics" category of exemption were to be assessed independent of the distinct epidemiological unit threshold, the Applicant's submissions would still fall well short of demonstrating the required criteria. The documentation provided by the Applicant fundamentally misunderstood what constitutes "rare and valuable poultry genetics" within the regulatory framework. Rather than presenting evidence of genomic distinctiveness, pedigree documentation, breed registry verification, or third-party scientific validation of unique genetic characteristics, the Applicant submitted materials primarily focused on commercial

applications of ostrich antibodies, business plans, and proposed research projects. These materials spoke to potential commercial value of ostrich products generally rather than demonstrating any genetically unique characteristics of the specific birds in the Applicant's flock. Moreover, the Applicant's submissions addressed the herd as a whole rather than identifying particular birds with exceptional genetic traits of significance to the broader poultry industry. The Response Letter correctly noted that "robust processes must be in place (ex. genomic testing) to actively select and breed for specific desirable traits," yet the Applicant provided neither evidence of such systematic genetic selection nor molecular-level proof of genetic uniqueness. Simply put, the Applicant's documentation has failed to establish the fundamental premise that its birds possessed genetics that are both rare and valuable, regardless of their epidemiological status.
[252] In short, it was the Applicant, not the Exemption Committee, that confused the exemption category of "distinct unit" with the threshold concept of "distinct epidemiological unit." The Committee adhered to the exemption framework as set out in policy and applied it correctly. Therefore, the Applicant's second unreasonableness allegation cannot succeed.
(iii) The Applicant's Argument on Inadequate Engagement with Evidence Fails
[253] The Applicant's third argument is that the Exemption Committee ignored operationspecific factors unique to the Applicant's situation and neglected a key precedent exemption that allegedly contradicts the Committee's reasoning on trade. I find that this argument is an improper invitation for this Court to reweigh evidence and a misreading of the facts and policy surrounding the precedent. While reasonableness review must be robust, reviewing courts cannot nitpick and fault a decision-maker for not cataloguing every fact and argument the

Applicant considers important. That is not what Vavilov expects. Reasons in administrative decisions are required to show that the decision maker grappled with the determinative issues and stayed attuned to the relevant evidence before them, but they do not need to read like a treatise addressing every factor deemed important by the applicants: Vavilov paras 91-93 and $125-128$.
[254] I am satisfied that the content of the Response Letter and Internal Recommendation Memorandum demonstrates that the Exemption Committee did turn its mind to many of the operation-specific factors the Applicant highlights. It records the on-site inspection and the Premises Investigation Questionnaire, noting shared personnel and equipment, the central pond attracting hundreds of wild birds, and outdoor pens. Those observations go directly to the claim that the operation-specific conditions of natural immunity and efforts of isolation rendered selective depopulation feasible and shows to this Court the facts that the Committee deemed important in evaluating these alternative measures. The Memorandum then addresses the correct threshold question under the 2022 ERP: could any subgroup be "separated from an infected susceptible population such that they are not considered exposed." The answer that "all birds on the infected premises were under the same risk of HPAI exposure" shows that the Committee rejected the Applicant's on-premise condition as meeting the threshold of epidemiological separation that underpins every exemption pathway. Moreover, the Memorandum records that "a significant policy deviation was considered (i.e. to employ selective culling ... rather than stamping-out)" but was declined after multidisciplinary consultation because of domestic-disease, public-health, and trade risks. This explicit reference confirms that alternatives such as retaining a naturally immune flock were examined and even debated, not ignored.

[255] Vavilov cautions that a specialized agency's demonstrated expertise may justify treating some issues in less detail, and that such an agency's reasons will often rely on concepts and language specific to its field: Vavilov at paras 92-93. Many of the "unique" factors the Applicant presses, including longer lifespan, relative difficulty of repopulation, and remoteness of the premises from commercial poultry operations, are precisely the kind of scientific, medical, and veterinary risk variables the CFIA is equipped to weigh. Here, the Committee's heavier focus on explaining about exposure pathways, biosecurity realities, and international obligations reflects a proper exercise of the Agency's expertise. As such, its decision to focus less, or not at all, on each individual factor deemed important by the Applicant aligns squarely with the principles set out in Vavilov.
[256] When situated in the context of the full record, the Committee's chosen focus is even more reasonable. Beyond what is listed by the Committee in the Internal Recommendation Memorandum regarding shared personnel and equipment, the central pond, and outdoor pens, the record also shows that the Applicant's farm also exhibited sick ostriches being moved to treatment pens in contravention of quarantine requirements, dead ostriches dragged through pens populated with living ones without robust separation measures, and unauthorized individuals walking inside the infected zone. Seeing the many issues with the biosecurity conditions at the Applicant's premises, I find no basis to interfere with the Exemption Committee's approach of engaging more substantively with epidemiological and trade considerations and not providing lengthy elaboration and addressing every point that the Applicant deems more important.
[257] As to the Exemption Committee's alleged failure to address "contradictory" evidence that the March 2022 Exemption did not cause trade disruptions, I find this submission unpersuasive.

In my view, the suggestion that the earlier exemption contradicts the Committee's present reasoning on trade rests on two fundamental errors in logic.
[258] The first error is a flawed analogy. For the March 2022 exemption to serve as a contradiction, it must be meaningfully analogous to the present case. Only then could the Applicant plausibly argue that the CFIA's concern about trade consequences in this instance is inconsistent with and thus contradicted by its past practice. However, the factual circumstances in these two cases cannot be more different. The March 2022 Exemption was granted only after the barns of turkeys in question met the strict distinct epidemiological unit threshold: they were fully enclosed, ventilated independently, staffed separately, and never exposed to the virus. No comparable epidemiological segregation exists on the Applicant's open-air ostrich premises, where wild ducks, weasels, and shared staff had roamed without much hindrance. Given these substantial differences, the March 2022 Exemption simply does not meaningfully contradict the Exemption Committee's analysis or conclusions in the present matter.
[259] The second error is a defect in causal reasoning. Specifically, the Applicant appears to conflate the absence of negative trade consequences in a prior case with the absence of risk in its own. This reasoning is faulty. The fact that one exemption under materially different circumstances did not result in adverse outcomes does not imply that a different exemption under weaker biosecurity conditions poses no risk. The Internal Recommendation Memorandum records the Exemption Committee's consultation with experts both internal and international, who confirmed that major partners, such as the United States, have "and would continue to, apply a stamping-out approach to the detection of HPAI on ostrich farms." This expert

assessment directly supports the Exemption Committee's conclusion regarding potential international implications for this specific case.
[260] Properly understood, the March 2022 Exemption is not contradictory evidence but rather complementary evidence that reinforces the importance of strict biosecurity conditions for any exemption consideration. True contradictory evidence would need to demonstrate either that similarly situated premises received different treatment or that international partners had explicitly indicated acceptance of exemptions for premises with compromised biosecurity. The Applicant offered neither. Instead, it has relied on a factually and epidemiologically distinct precedent that does not demand explicit engagement by the Exemption Committee. Its omission from the Committee's reasons does not render the Exemption Denial unreasonable.
(iv) The CFIA's Reasons Properly Reflect the Impact of Its Decision on the Applicant
[261] The law is clear that near-draconian measures may be justified when necessary to safeguard broader public interests, even where such measures may negatively impact private property or economic interests: David Hunt FC at para 52. However, this principle does not license the imposition of such measures without due regard for their impact on those affected. Indeed, the central tenet of Canadian administrative law, and the animating purpose of judicial review, is to ensure that administrative decision-makers remain accountable and do not exercise "absolute and untrammelled 'discretion':" Roncarelli v Duplessis, [1959] SCR 121 at p 140.
[262] Since the Supreme Court's decision in Vavilov, there has been an increased emphasis on engaging with the perspective of the individuals affected by administrative decisions. Reasons must not only be coherent with legal interpretation and institutional logic, but must also reflect

meaningful, humane engagement with the lived realities and consequences for those whose rights, livelihoods, liberty, or dignity are at stake. In practical terms, administrative decisionmakers must remain responsive to the applicants' specific circumstances and the gravity of the decision's impact, and their reasons must be calibrated accordingly. This obligation is particularly important where decisions result in harsh or irreversible impacts, as is the case here, because it is in such moments that the administrative decision-maker's duty to explain "why its decision best reflects the legislature's intention" becomes most acute.
[263] Having reviewed the reasons provided to the Applicant, including the email communicating the denial and the attached Response Letter, I find that the CFIA's explanation has met this standard. The reasons adequately responded to the Applicant's circumstances, and articulated, in a transparent and clear manner, why the decision aligned with Parliament's intent. The Agency's communication demonstrated a humane engagement with the gravity of its decision and the impact it would have on the Applicant and its principals.
[264] The email, likely the first communication read by the Applicant, recognizes "the tremendous amount of stress" the decision may cause, and provides mental health resources while offering opportunities for continued dialogue with "the necessary parties from the CFIA." This overt acknowledgment of human impact reflects precisely the responsive justification that Vavilov calls for in paragraphs 133 to 135 when a decision threatens an individual's livelihood. I couple this language with the extensive and continuous communications the CFIA had maintained with the Applicant's principals through virtual meetings, phone calls, emails, and onsite visits throughout the entire process. I am convinced that the Agency did not treat the

Applicant's case as just another routine bureaucratic exercise, but recognized the severe economic and emotional consequences for the Applicant's principals.
[265] On a substantive level, the Response Letter explicitly ties the Exemption Denial to the legislative purpose set out in the Act. It first explains that the Stamping-Out Policy "reflects the risks posed by HPAI infected poultry flocks to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife," and then states that implementation was necessary "for Canada to mitigate the risks posed by HPAI infected poultry, maintain its international obligations and the expectation of our trading partners." This directly addresses the Act's core purposes of proactive disease management, protection of public health, and preservation of Canada's international trade status, as recognized in the David Hunt cases, River Valley Poultry Farm, Paradis Honey, and Kohl. The Agency's explanation clearly indicates that the decision was made to fulfil the statutory mandate, not as a whimsical punishment. This level of specific reasoning satisfies Vavilov's demand that the decision-maker justify how the outcome aligns with the legislature's purpose when the stakes are high.
[266] The CFIA's reasons also demonstrate substantive engagement with the Applicant's specific circumstances rather than merely providing generic justifications. The Response Letter acknowledged the Applicant's submission of a Distinct Unit Request Package and addressed the specific exemption category the Applicant had attempted to meet with the documents it had provided. The Letter provided clear explanations why the Applicant's premises failed to qualify as a distinct epidemiological unit and why the claimed genetic value did not meet the threshold for the "rare and valuable poultry genetics" exemption.

IX. The Applicant's Charter, Bill of Rights, and jurisdictional arguments have been abandoned
[267] The Applicant's Notice of Application and Amended Notice of Application both raised arguments that were not pursued in its memorandum of fact and law. These included claims that the CFIA's decisions interfered with provincial jurisdiction over health, property rights, and animal genetic development, and that the decisions violated the Applicant's right to property under the Canadian Bill of Rights and infringed unidentified Charter rights.
[268] During the hearing, Respondent's counsel noted these arguments were absent from the Applicant's memorandum. When questioned on this point, Applicant's counsel acknowledged the Charter issue was abandoned, but suggested the jurisdictional issue should still somehow work its way into the reasonableness analysis, despite admitting it was not in their memorandum.
[269] I deem all these grounds to have been abandoned by virtue of the Applicant counsel's failure to include them in their memorandum of fact and law. Counsel cannot expect this Court to address and resolve an unsupported jurisdictional argument. For a case that is of such urgency and significance to both parties, issues and arguments should be clearly presented so they can be properly addressed and assessed on their merits. Hearings are no places for surprises, and counsel, I note, brought more than one to this hearing.
X. Conclusion
[270] For the reasons provided, these applications for judicial review are dismissed.

[271] The parties agreed that if the Respondent was successful, a lump sum award of costs in its favour of $\$ 15,000$ would be appropriate. I agree with this assessment and hereby award costs to the Respondent in that amount.
[272] I apologize for the length of these Reasons. The Applicant advanced many issues and made detailed submissions over two days of hearing. Although none was successful, they were deserving of detailed consideration and assessment.

# JUDGMENT IN T-294-25 and T-432-25 

THIS COURT'S JUDGMENT is that these applications are dismissed, the injunction dated January 31, 2025 is vacated, and the Respondent is awarded costs of $\$ 15,000$, all in.

## File: legal/hhs_secretary_impact.md

You are absolutely right to press on this. The letter from the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the NIH, and the Commissioner of the FDA (the "HHS Letter") is a **highly significant development**, even though it post-dates Justice Zinn's decision and the CFIA's original decisions.

While it cannot be used to argue that Justice Zinn erred *because he didn't have it* (he couldn't have), it dramatically shifts the landscape for the appeal and any subsequent actions. Here's how:

**Impact on the Appeal and Overall Legal Strategy:**

1.  **Massive Corroboration of "Unique Scientific Value":**
    *   **Argument:** Justice Zinn (and the CFIA) may have underestimated or improperly weighed the "rare and valuable genetics" or unique scientific value of the flock (Appeal Argument #2). The HHS Letter provides powerful, high-level, independent, international validation of this very point.
    *   **How to Use:** While not new evidence *for Zinn's decision*, it can be argued that the *type* of value the Applicant was asserting (and which the CFIA/Zinn may have downplayed by sticking to traditional breed definitions – para 251) is now being explicitly recognized by leading global health authorities for *this specific flock*. This strengthens the argument that the CFIA's initial assessment was unreasonable in its narrowness and that Zinn erred in upholding that narrowness.
    *   The letter specifically states: "we believe there is significant value in studying this population" due to (1) longitudinal studies of H5N1 natural history and immune longevity, (2) potential to study antibody levels and cellular immunity, and (3) opportunity to study antibody-dependent enhancement and therapeutics. This directly supports the Applicant's long-standing research claims (paras 13, 26).

2.  **Reframing the "Public Interest" and "International Obligations":**
    *   **Argument:** The CFIA heavily relies on the "Stamping-Out Policy" being aligned with international norms (WOAH) and necessary for trade (paras 93, 98-100, 255). Justice Zinn found this reliance reasonable.
    *   **How to Use:** The HHS Letter introduces a compelling *countervailing international public interest* – the public interest in scientific advancement and pandemic preparedness, as articulated by a major trading partner and global health leader. It proposes an *alternative* international collaboration that involves *preserving* the flock. This challenges the CFIA's (and Zinn's acceptance of) a monolithic view of international obligations and impacts. The letter states: "We propose that our governments work together to devise more nuanced and thoughtful protocols...for controlling outbreaks in domestic flocks."

3.  **Challenging the Proportionality and Necessity of Culling (Now with International Expert Backing):**
    *   **Argument:** The decision to cull the entire flock, especially given their reported health and the passage of time (Appeal Argument #2, Proportionality), may be disproportionate.
    *   **How to Use:** The HHS Letter directly supports this by stating:
        *   "...the decision to cull the entire flock...made nearly six months after the initial positive test results—will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds."
        *   "...efforts to extirpate it by culling birds will be fruitless unless we are willing to exterminate every wild bird in North America."
        *   "...culling these unique animals can disrupt the livelihood of farmers, especially in cases where surviving animals present no further risk."
        *   This bolsters the argument that the CFIA's rigid application of the Stamping-Out policy was unreasonable in *this specific context*, and Zinn erred in not finding it so.

4.  **Strengthening Arguments for Remittal with Directions:**
    *   **Argument:** If the appeal court finds an error by Justice Zinn and decides to remit the matter to the CFIA for re-decision, the HHS Letter becomes crucial *new evidence* that the CFIA would be obligated to consider.
    *   **How to Use:** The appeal can argue that, should the matter be sent back, the CFIA must now grapple with this significant international scientific and diplomatic intervention. This wasn't available at the time of the original Exemption Denial.

5.  **Potential for "Fresh Evidence" on Appeal (Though a High Bar):**
    *   While typically appeals are restricted to the record before the lower court, there are very narrow exceptions for admitting "fresh evidence." The criteria usually involve the evidence not being discoverable by reasonable diligence before the original hearing, being relevant, credible, and potentially impacting the outcome.
    *   **How to Use (Cautiously):** It's unlikely the letter itself would be admitted to *re-judge Zinn's decision*. However, it could be presented to the Court of Appeal to demonstrate the *gravity and evolving nature of the public interest* surrounding this specific flock, potentially influencing the remedy if the appeal is successful on other grounds (e.g., strengthening the case for remittal with strong directions to consider this new context).

**Revised Appeal Arguments Incorporating the HHS Letter:**

The existing appeal arguments remain valid. The HHS letter doesn't negate them but rather adds significant weight and new dimensions, particularly to:

*   **Argument 2 (Error in Applying Reasonableness Standard to Unique Flock):**
    *   **"Rare and Valuable Genetics" / Unique Scientific Value:** Massively bolstered. It's no longer just the Applicant's assertion; it's a view shared by top U.S. health agencies regarding *this flock*. This makes the CFIA's (and Zinn's) potentially narrow interpretation of "value" even more questionable.
    *   **Proportionality:** The letter directly questions the proportionality and ongoing necessity of the cull, lending expert international weight to this argument.

*   **Argument 3 (Poultry Classification & Viral Pathogenicity):**
    *   While not directly addressing classification, the letter's focus on the unique *research opportunity* presented by these ostriches due to their specific H5N1 exposure and survival implicitly supports the idea that they are not "just poultry" in the context of a generic stamping-out policy.

**How the "appeal_arguments.md" should be updated:**

A new section should be added, or existing strategic considerations expanded:

---
"...
**5. Impact of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Intervention (Post-Decision Development):**

*   **Argument:** While the letter from the U.S. HHS Secretary, NIH Director, and FDA Commissioner (dated May 23, 2025) post-dates Justice Zinn's decision and the CFIA's original determinations, it is a profoundly significant development that prospectively impacts the public interest considerations and the reasonableness of *ongoing* efforts to cull this specific flock.
*   **Basis for Consideration by the Court of Appeal (Indirectly and for Remedy):**
    *   **Corroboration of Unique Value:** The HHS Letter provides powerful, independent, and high-level international validation that *this specific flock* holds significant scientific value for H5N1 research, including immune response longevity, antibody studies, and therapeutic potential. This directly supports the Applicant's contention that the CFIA (and Justice Zinn in his review) failed to adequately or reasonably weigh the unique scientific value, potentially by applying an overly narrow definition of "rare and valuable genetics" (para 251).
    *   **Reframing "Public Interest" and "International Implications":** The CFIA's justification for the Stamping-Out Policy heavily relies on international norms (WOAH) and trade implications (paras 93, 98-100, 255). The HHS Letter presents a *competing and compelling international public interest* advocated by a major trading partner: the advancement of global scientific understanding of H5N1. It proposes international collaboration to *study*, not cull, these ostriches, thereby challenging a monolithic interpretation of Canada's international obligations.
    *   **Questioning Proportionality and Necessity:** The HHS Letter explicitly states that culling the flock now, months after infection and with observed recovery, "will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds" and that culling is a "potentially disproportionate measure" given their asymptomatic status and potential immunity. This expert international opinion supports the argument that the CFIA's inflexible adherence to the Stamping-Out Policy in this specific, evolved context is unreasonable, and Justice Zinn may have erred in not finding it so.
    *   **Relevance to Remedy (if Appeal Successful):** Should the appeal succeed and the matter be remitted to the CFIA, this letter constitutes new, highly material evidence that the CFIA would be duty-bound to consider. It fundamentally alters the factual and policy matrix for any future decision regarding this flock.
    *   **Overall Gravity:** The HHS Letter underscores the extraordinary nature of this case and the potentially significant loss to global scientific understanding if the cull proceeds, arguing for the utmost scrutiny of the original decisions.

Winning this appeal will be challenging given the deference afforded to the CFIA on technical matters and the judge's thorough reasons. The strongest arguments will likely revolve around:
1.  The procedural unreasonableness of the Exemption Committee not waiting for its own commissioned report.
2.  The substantive unreasonableness of the CFIA applying its general policies inflexibly to such a unique research flock without a more tailored assessment, especially concerning the "rare and valuable genetics" criteria (now powerfully corroborated by the HHS Letter) and the novel viral strain.
3.  Arguing that Justice Zinn erred in law by not finding these CFIA actions unreasonable or procedurally unfair, particularly in light of the evidence of the flock's unique value and the disproportionate impact of culling.

**International Options Beyond the Canadian Appeal:**

The HHS Letter itself *is* the most significant international option initiated so far. It represents a government-to-government communication channel. Further international options could include:

1.  **Diplomatic Channels:** The Applicant's supporters could encourage further diplomatic engagement between the U.S. (and potentially other interested countries like Japan, given the Kyoto University connection mentioned in para 38 and the SaveOurOstriches website) and Canada, emphasizing the scientific collaboration benefits.
2.  **World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH):**
    *   While CFIA claims alignment with WOAH (para 93), the HHS Letter's suggestion for "more nuanced and thoughtful protocols" implies that a blanket stamping-out approach for a unique research flock with potential immunity might not be the *only* WOAH-compliant interpretation, especially if robust quarantine and research protocols are proposed.
    *   The Applicant could, through scientific and veterinary experts, attempt to present the case to relevant WOAH committees or experts, highlighting the unique research potential and arguing for a more flexible interpretation of guidelines in such exceptional circumstances. This is a long shot for direct intervention but could add to the body of expert opinion.
3.  **International Scientific Community Mobilization:** The HHS Letter is a huge step. Further mobilization of international virologists, immunologists, and epidemiologists to publicly support the preservation of the flock for research can amplify the pressure and highlight the scientific loss.
4.  **Media Campaign with International Reach:** Leveraging the HHS letter to gain more prominent international media coverage can increase public and political pressure on the Canadian government.

The HHS Letter significantly elevates the case beyond a purely domestic regulatory dispute. It frames it as a matter of international scientific importance and potential public health benefit, which provides a powerful lever for both the appeal (in terms of context and gravity) and for broader strategic efforts.

# **Legal arguments to help win your specific case**

and save your ostriches. This is a challenging situation, especially given the previous court ruling. However, here are several legal arguments and strategies that could be explored with your legal counsel, focusing on the unique aspects of your ostrich farm and the evolving circumstances:

**1\. Misapplication of "Poultry" Standards to a Unique Ostrich Research Flock:**

* **Argument:** The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) "exposed flock" designation and its "stamping out" policy are primarily designed for commercial poultry operations, where rapid disease transmission and broad economic impacts are the main concerns.1 It could be argued that rigidly applying these standards to your ostriches—a genetically distinct, long-lived species with potentially different immune responses and a primary value in research and breeding, not mass meat production 3—is an unreasonable application of the *Health of Animals Act*.  
* **Supporting Points:**  
  * Highlight the differences in ostrich physiology and their observed lower mortality rate in this outbreak compared to typical avian influenza in poultry.3  
  * Emphasize that your farm's focus has shifted from meat production to breeding and antibody research, making the "commercial poultry industry" protection rationale less directly applicable.3  
  * This argument seeks to show that the CFIA's expertise, while valid for poultry, may not have been appropriately nuanced for the specific case of ostriches with unique scientific potential.

**2\. Evolving Public Interest: Scientific Value of Survivors:**

* **Argument:** The initial court decision weighed your farm's losses against the "broader public interest in protecting public health and maintaining trade stability".1 A compelling new argument could be that the surviving ostriches, having potentially developed immunity and shown resilience to this specific HPAI strain 6, now represent a *significant and competing public interest*: the advancement of scientific understanding of avian influenza and the development of potential antibodies or treatments.3  
* **Supporting Points:**  
  * The fact that these birds have remained healthy for months 3 diminishes the *current* risk they pose, while their scientific value has increased.  
  * Present evidence or expert testimony (potentially from figures like Dr. Tsukamoto or others who see research value 3) that studying this flock could yield benefits for animal and even human health, aligning with a broader public good.

**3\. Procedural Unfairness: Failure to Consider New, Material Facts:**

* **Argument:** While the initial judicial review was limited to the evidence available to the CFIA in December 2024/January 2025 1, the CFIA's *ongoing insistence* on culling, despite months of no illness in the flock 3, could be challenged as procedurally unfair or unreasonable. The continued good health of the flock and the significant passage of time are new, material facts that fundamentally alter the risk assessment and the necessity of the cull.  
* **Supporting Points:**  
  * Argue that a refusal by the CFIA to re-test (even if their policy is against it 5) or to scientifically re-evaluate the *current* risk in light of these new facts is arbitrary.  
  * This challenges the inflexibility of the CFIA's stance, suggesting that a decision reasonable in January may no longer be reasonable given the changed circumstances.

**4\. Re-evaluating Exemption Criteria: The "Acquired Uniqueness" of the Flock:**

* **Argument:** The CFIA previously denied an exemption because the farm reportedly did not provide sufficient proof that the birds were "rare or unique enough" under standard criteria (like breeding books or genomic testing for recognized rare breeds).3 A creative argument could be that this flock has *acquired* a profound and scientifically relevant "uniqueness" *because* of its survival and apparent immune response to this specific avian influenza event.6  
* **Supporting Points:**  
  * This "acquired uniqueness" makes them invaluable for research into HPAI resilience and antibody development, a form of rarity not contemplated by typical breed-based exemption criteria.  
  * This argument attempts to fit the flock's current status into the spirit of the exemption, even if the original application did not meet the standard interpretation.

**5\. Proportionality and Necessity of Culling in the Current Context:**

* **Argument:** The legal principle of proportionality requires that government actions, especially those with severe consequences, be no more drastic than necessary to achieve the legislative objective. Given the ostriches' current health status (months without illness 3), their potential immunity 8, and their significant scientific value 3, the extreme measure of culling the entire flock may no longer be proportionate to the *actual current* risk they pose.  
* **Supporting Points:**  
  * If the disease has run its course within this specific flock and survivors are immune, culling them may not effectively serve the *Health of Animals Act's* goals of "controlling" or "eradicating" *this specific viral presence in these specific animals*.  
  * Argue that less drastic means, such as strict quarantine combined with a structured scientific research program under CFIA oversight, would be a more proportionate response that balances public health with scientific advancement.

**6\. Addressing Biosecurity Concerns and Proposing Enhanced Protocols:**

* **Argument:** The initial court ruling noted "many issues" with biosecurity at the farm.1 If these issues have been rectified or can be demonstrably and verifiably addressed, this could weaken one of the CFIA's justifications.  
* **Supporting Points:**  
  * Proactively develop and present a comprehensive, stringent, and independently verifiable biosecurity plan tailored to ostriches and the specific risks. This plan should aim to exceed standard poultry protocols.  
  * Offer to bear the costs of independent monitoring of this enhanced biosecurity. This directly counters the CFIA's concerns about viral persistence and spread due to environmental factors.2

**7\. Challenging the Characterization of the Viral Strain and Its Specific Risk in Ostriches:**

* **Argument:** Your farm's statement indicated the illness involved a new hybrid of Low Pathogenic (LPAI) and High Pathogenic (HPAI) Avian Influenza, with the LPAI portion suggesting it was less deadly.3 If further scientific evidence can bolster this claim, or demonstrate that this specific strain behaves differently and less severely in ostriches than typical HPAI in poultry, it could be argued that the CFIA's standard "stamping out" protocol for HPAI is an overreaction.  
* **Supporting Points:**  
  * This requires credible, independent virological expertise and analysis, if obtainable (recognizing CFIA's restrictions on third-party testing 3).  
  * The observed lower mortality rate in your ostriches compared to the \>90% often seen in poultry 5 could support the argument that the risk profile is different.

**Important Considerations for Your Legal Strategy:**

* **The Appeal:** Your primary current legal avenue is the appeal of the Federal Court's decision.6 These arguments need to be framed to demonstrate that the initial judgment contained errors of law or made unreasonable findings based on the evidence then available or the interpretation of CFIA's duties.  
* **Expert Evidence:** Any arguments challenging the CFIA's scientific rationale or proposing scientific alternatives will require robust, credible expert testimony. The previous judge was reluctant to "arbitrate scientific contests" 10, so the evidence must be compelling.  
* **Focus on Reasonableness and Procedural Fairness:** Many of these arguments hinge on demonstrating that the CFIA's actions, while perhaps authorized by statute generally, were unreasonable or procedurally unfair *in their specific application to your unique circumstances*.  
* **Documentation:** Thorough documentation of the birds' health, the farm's research activities and value, and any communications with CFIA will be vital.

These are complex legal arguments that require careful development with experienced legal counsel. The goal is to present a case that either the initial decision was flawed or that circumstances have materially changed such that the cull order is no longer a reasonable or proportionate measure.







H5N1 is unavoidable .... what are we going to do? Cull all of the birds in Canada?

Mr. Paul MacKinnon
President, Canadian Food Inspection Agency
1400 Merivale Road
Ottawa, ON, K1A 0Y9, Canada

**Re: H5N1 Infected Ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farm in Edgewood, B.C.**

Dear President MacKinnon:

Thank you for taking the time to speak with us yesterday in connection with the approximately 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farm in Edgewood, B.C. We are very grateful for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s (CFIA) willingness to consider the proposal we discussed, which is further outlined in this letter. We value our partnership with CFIA and look forward to continued collaboration on this matter and others.

We are respectfully requesting CFIA to consider not culling the entire flock of ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farm. Given that a proportion of these ostriches were infected with avian influenza (H5N1) last year, we believe there is significant value in studying this population, for several reasons:

(1) The flock is a controlled environment that enables longitudinal studies of the natural history status post H5N1 infection. Ostriches can live up to 50 years, providing the opportunity for future insights into immune longevity associated with H5N1 virus.
(2) The potential to study both antibody levels and cellular immunity to help further our scientific understanding of the virus and the immune physiologic response.
(3) The opportunity to study the important principle of antibody-dependent enhancement and possible therapeutics in the setting of prior infection.

The United States Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), would like to offer our full support and assistance in conducting diagnostic testing and undertaking a long-term body of research on these ostriches, contingent on CFIA’s approval and that of the farm owners. The United States government has been tracking H5N1 and studying it very intensely to prepare for a potential epidemic, including working on vaccines and studying the interaction between the virus and the immune system. We believe significant scientific knowledge may be garnered from following the ostriches in a controlled environment at the Universal Ostrich Farm.

While we understand the importance of preventing the spread of H5N1, we believe the decision to cull the entire flock of approximately 400 ostriches—made nearly six months after the initial positive test results—will not influence the current health status of the surviving birds. Further, because avian influenza has been around for thousands of years and is endemic in wild bird populations in the United States and Canada, efforts to extirpate it by culling birds will be fruitless

Mr. Paul MacKinnon
Page 2

unless we are willing to exterminate every wild bird in North America. We propose that our governments work together to devise more nuanced and thoughtful protocols—based upon the emerging scientific evidence—for controlling outbreaks in domestic flocks.

Culling infected flocks should be a judicious decision, one that considers both scientific evidence and the long-term impact on both animal welfare and agricultural sustainability. The indiscriminate destruction of entire flocks without up-to-date testing and evaluation can have significant consequences, including the loss of valuable genetic stock that may help explain risk factors for H5N1 mortality. This may be important for future agricultural resilience.

With respect to the specific ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farm, given that only a fraction of these ostriches died, and no symptoms have been reported in the remaining birds for several months, we believe the situation requires further careful evaluation. It is well-documented that avian influenza does not persist in birds indefinitely, and many avian species recover from mild cases without transmission. In fact, avian influenza typically has an incubation period of just 3-7 days and is most transmissible during the acute phase of infection. The fact that the remaining ostriches have been asymptomatic for months suggests they may have already overcome the infection with downstream immunity, making the culling of all healthy birds a potentially disproportionate measure. Additionally, culling these unique animals can disrupt the livelihood of farmers, especially in cases where surviving animals present no further risk.

As outlined in this letter, we respectfully request CFIA to partner with us on this important issue. Avian influenza is a shared threat that we jointly face. We are fully committed to supporting CFIA and Canadian farmers in safeguarding both public health and animal welfare and to further studying this important and unique flock for scientific advancement. We look forward to collaborating with CFIA on this important issue.

Sincerely,

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Headline: BC Ostrich Farm Vows Appeal After Federal Court Upholds CFIA Cull Order for 400 Birds**

**EDGEWOOD, B.C. – May 27, 2025** – Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. is preparing to appeal a Federal Court decision that upheld the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) order to euthanize its flock of approximately 400 ostriches following an H5N1 avian influenza detection late last year. The May 13, 2025, ruling by Justice Russel Zinn found the CFIA's actions to be reasonable and procedurally fair based on the information available at the time of the initial orders.

The case, which has drawn significant public attention and even international governmental interest, pits the CFIA's mandate to control animal diseases and protect public health and trade against the farm owners' assertions of their flock's unique scientific value and current health.

The situation began in early December 2024 when Universal Ostrich Farms, a 65-acre operation in Edgewood, B.C., primarily managed by two principals with decades of experience, observed respiratory symptoms in some ostriches. This followed reported exposure to wild ducks (Decision, para [29]). After an anonymous tip about multiple ostrich deaths, the CFIA intervened on December 28, 2024, imposing a verbal quarantine (Decision, para [30]). Swab samples collected on December 30 from two carcasses tested positive for H5 avian influenza on December 31 (Decision, paras [31]-[32]). The CFIA issued a "Notice to Dispose" for the entire flock just 41 minutes later, citing its 2022 Event Response Plan (ERP) which operationalizes the "Stamping-Out Policy" (Decision, para [1], [33]).

Universal Ostrich Farms, which transitioned its focus around 2020 from meat production to research involving the extraction of immunoglobulin Y (antibodies) from ostrich eggs for potential human-virus diagnostics (Decision, para [13], [26]), applied for an exemption from depopulation. They argued the flock constituted a "distinct epidemiological unit" with "rare and valuable poultry genetics" (Decision, para [1], [49]). The farm owners also highlighted their long-standing selective breeding program dating back to the 1990s (Decision, para [13], [25]) and their belief that many ostriches had developed natural immunity after a previous illness in 2020 and the recent outbreak (Decision, para [28], [34]; website).

On January 10, 2025, the CFIA denied the exemption request, stating the farm failed to demonstrate a distinct unexposed unit and provided insufficient proof of genetic rarity or value under CFIA's criteria, which the agency's Exemption Committee felt required evidence like breeding books or genomic testing for recognized traits (Decision, para [1], [41], [56], [251]). The farm has maintained on its website, SaveOurOstriches.com, that the birds have been healthy for months since the last reported death on January 15, 2025 (Website; Decision, para [42]).

In his 152-page decision (2025 FC 878), Justice Zinn dismissed the farm's applications for judicial review. He emphasized that the court's role was not to re-decide the case but to assess the reasonableness and procedural fairness of the CFIA's decisions based on the record before the agency at the time (Decision, paras [3], [7]). He found the CFIA's Stamping-Out Policy to be reasonable and consistent with its mandate under the Health of Animals Act and international obligations (Decision, paras [67], [93], [169]).

Key arguments raised by the farm and addressed by Justice Zinn included:
*   **Procedural Fairness (Dr. French's Report):** The farm argued unfairness because the CFIA's Exemption Committee did not wait for a literature review on avian flu in ostriches it had commissioned on the morning of its January 10 decision. Justice Zinn found this was not a "fatal flaw" as the report, when later submitted, would not have altered the outcome (Decision, paras [233], [239], [241]).
*   **Application of Policy to Unique Flock:** The farm contended the CFIA unreasonably applied poultry-focused policies to their unique research ostriches. Justice Zinn upheld the CFIA's application, noting its broad discretion (Decision, paras [83]-[84], [194]).
*   **"Rare and Valuable Genetics" Exemption:** The CFIA, and subsequently Justice Zinn, found the farm did not provide sufficient proof under the policy's criteria (Decision, paras [56], [251]).
*   **Legitimate Expectation:** The farm argued communications from a CFIA Case Officer created a legitimate expectation regarding the exemption process. Justice Zinn found no "clear, unambiguous, and unqualified" representation that would create such an expectation for a specific outcome (Decision, para [217]-[224]).

The farm owners have announced their intention to appeal Justice Zinn's decision, according to their website.

Adding a new dimension to the case, a letter dated May 23, 2025, from high-ranking U.S. health officials, including the Secretary of Health and Human Services, was sent to the CFIA President. The letter respectfully requests the CFIA consider not culling the flock, citing "significant value in studying this population" for H5N1 natural history, immune longevity, and potential therapeutics. The U.S. officials offered support for long-term research on the ostriches and proposed collaboration on "more nuanced and thoughtful protocols" for controlling avian influenza outbreaks. (Source: `legal/rfk_letter.md`).

Further complicating the cull, the Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) voted on May 15, 2025, to refuse the ostrich carcasses at its landfill until the CFIA re-tests the currently healthy birds and makes the results public (Source: `saveourostriches.com/news/rdck-votes-to-refuse-ostrich-carcasses-at-landfills-until-testing-updated/`).

The CFIA has consistently maintained that its actions are necessary to protect animal health, public health, and Canada's international trade status, aligning with WOAH guidelines. The court ruling also noted that the farm could be eligible for compensation up to $3,000 per ostrich under existing regulations (Decision, para [85], [271]).

The future of the Universal Ostrich Farms flock remains uncertain as legal proceedings continue and international scientific interest grows.

Unknown speaker 00:00 
Hi everyone, Katie from Universal Ostrich, happy Monday and it is a happy Monday, we got an appeal in so that is fantastic. What does that mean? So I want to clear things up because I think a lot of people are like, oh great the birds are saved and this is fantastic news. 

Unknown speaker 00:20 
That's what we're fighting for. I've got some notes from the lawyer just because I want to be very accurate and our lawyers are saying like this pause is a result of the council's agreement during an expedited scheduling process. 

Unknown speaker 00:35 
No order halting enforcement or no court order halting enforcement has been issued. So there is no court ordered halting the order, the call order. This has not been enforced yet. What they have agreed upon is that if we get our stay motion which is next approved on an expedited tie in a timely manner and an expedited process then we will have that. 

Unknown speaker 01:06 
Then they will halt the order, the call order, oh my gosh, the call order. So right now we have an appeal in and that is fantastic but we are not safe. So continued love and support and momentum forward is going to be crucial at this time where we are fighting for the rights of Canadians. 

Unknown speaker 01:30 
So this is all about the rights of Canadians protecting our farmers and we need to pay special attention and which we're trying to do here on that stamping out order stamping out policy. It's an outdated policy that needs revamping and it needs to be readjusted to protect our farmers and to protect our Canadians and everybody around the world because it's clearly not been working for decades now and it's just putting us in a very vulnerable position. 

Unknown speaker 02:00 
as we as we go forward so the yeah the Attorney General I wanted to mention with the drone information I know there's been a lot of speculation of the the farm being not safe we have the RCMP working on this this is great they've been fantastic as I continue to say there's nothing we feel very safe here with with what is happening it's directed sadly enough with the ostriches so we are just trying to deal with that investigation but we don't do know that I mean it could be just simply people flying their drones from the highway somebody as this gets bigger there's definitely more attention on the farm it's been creating some hassle and some some benefit that's for sure and one of the benefits is that we have met some really incredible people that continue to pour in their love support and connect with one another to try to create the most valuable change that's possible. 

Unknown speaker 03:06 
Representatives from the CFIA appearing before a parliamentary committee concerning avian flu and the devastating impact on the duck industry and the delay in their report assured RMPs that they were always open to new science. 

Unknown speaker 03:25 
We have yet to witness this declared statement and we're really inviting them to let us help them, let us help you. I think that's very important that we all start to see these policies and organizations which are government money and government, sorry which our tax dollars pay for. 

Unknown speaker 03:47 
We just want to see that there is more accountability in their actions. We want to revamp the structure. We want to revisit policies that are clearly not working. We want to advance science to help our farmers. 

Unknown speaker 04:03 
We want to have a voice as the Canadian citizens and people around the world in the organizations that are there and are supposed to be helping us along the way. Sorry my voice is going. We stand together in unity. 

Unknown speaker 04:19 
We stand together with peace and love, support. What universal ostrich stands for these last months has been bringing together people in a healing way. We are get so many people here that leave here and go this just doesn't seem like a protest and I'm like well it isn't a protest. 

Unknown speaker 04:40 
It's a support group. We are a group of individuals that are collaborating and all coming together to try to better humanity and to have our voices heard and I think that is so important. With the power of our voices and the power of the all of us wanting positive change, we can make that happen. 

Unknown speaker 05:02 
But we need to stay focused on the mission. The mission is it's all about saving the farmers, saving our food. It's about protecting these policies, but protecting them, redoing them, but protecting that then. 

Unknown speaker 05:19 
You know, let's revamp these policies. Let's bring science forward. Let's not shut the science out. There should be no war. There shouldn't be the threat of that it's a crime to test or treat your own animals. 

Unknown speaker 05:32 
It should be a human right. It should be a natural right of all of our citizens and all of us across the world. So, I have, yeah, it's been a long journey. I want to continue to thank you for all of your love and support that continues to be so much negativity online and it breaks my heart. 

Unknown speaker 05:59 
it breaks my heart. I you know we're all in this this world together we're one big family all fighting for the same thing we want a better world. I know that one person's would take on something is not going to be the same as another person's take on it but we shouldn't derail each other. 

Unknown speaker 06:19 
I just think we should really come together by the power of just even all of us uniting in this journey. Imagine what we can do when we show each other and prove that we can make the change when we come together. 

Unknown speaker 06:34 
The people's voice matters and unity matters. Then we move on to the next change and we make change together and we should learn from one another. I'm open to taking on new ideas and educating myself on different theories. 

Unknown speaker 06:49 
I don't know what that looks like for me down the road but doesn't make me really want to learn about that if I'm constantly being attacked or the science here is being attacked. Our goal and mission for the last four years has been dedicated to just bettering humanity by bringing a new innovative research to the forefront that was going to offer natural opportunity rather than that of synthetic opportunity of vaccinations and mRNA and we wanted to do something natural. 

Unknown speaker 07:28 
That was always the goal here and that is our goal. We've been so grateful to have Secretary Kennedy, John Katamadides, who continues to support our farm and the rights of the people around the world with this overreach and what we're dealing with here. 

Unknown speaker 07:47 
We have Dr. Oz that spoke on us, just grateful for these names, people that are collaborating and coming together. I still have hope that with Kennedy's letter that that would open a door for us to work with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency would offer so much opportunity. 

Unknown speaker 08:11 
It would offer opportunity for our agricultural industry and our human health. Anyways, this Friday as well we have a convoy that is coming out here. I am kind of learning a little bit more about it. 

Unknown speaker 08:24 
It's just a convoy of support. We are really focusing on healing here at Universal Ostrich Farm so we have community and we have different celebrations for different people, things that they've been going through, caring for one another, and we have ceremony. 

Unknown speaker 08:43 
We've been so blessed to have Indigenous here sharing their culture with us, doing ceremony with our beautiful ostriches that need all the ceremony at the river every morning at eight. And it is just the most beautiful time to sit and heal your heart in this crazy world that we got going on around us. 

Unknown speaker 09:07 
I just wanna give a shout out to all of our family, extended family, all of you who've become our new ostrich family. I really do believe in this process. I believe that it's been a really long journey and it's been a long time. 

Unknown speaker 09:23 
But I believe that with this biggest challenge, we're gonna create the greatest opportunity. And we're gonna see it through. So with all your love, with all of your support, continue to follow, continue to follow here. 

Unknown speaker 09:37 
You can always, I said, will always bring you the most truthful and accurate information on my page here right now. It's kind of what I have control of and I'm just trying to keep up. Messages are hard, they're really hard for me to keep up with, but I am trying. 

Unknown speaker 09:52 
So please have patience with me. I want to answer everybody's question, questions, or I just wanna say thank you when you message me and I don't get a chance to say thank you. Remember, know that from my heart, thank you. 

Unknown speaker 10:07 
Thank you for taking the time to love, love our farm, love one another. Let's bring each other together, please, okay? Let's continue to be stronger together and see that with this opportunity, we can change so many other things in such a big way. 

Unknown speaker 10:24 
So I continue to love and support all of you. Thank you for all of your time and I'll give you updates as they come. But it was a great day, we do have that appeal in. So please, everybody, keep praying. 

Unknown speaker 10:36 
You can follow us and support us, pray, and come and visit us. This weekend's gonna be a very wonderful weekend full of prayer, love, and really great influencers and kind people coming to the farm. So let's continue on this journey together and let's create a win. 

Unknown speaker 10:53 
Love you all, bye bye.

Farm owner Katie Pasitney and her friend and sleuth Connie Shields have quite a tragic story. I’ve had two lengthy conversations with them and here is a synopsis of their plight.\nThe 400-ostrich farm switched from meat and eggs three years ago to a research facility collaborating with a Japanese scientist trying to develop covid 19 antigens. Their experiments yielded robust antigens in the egg yolks that were processed into nutraceuticals administered as a pill, lozenge, or nasal spray. It totally neutralized covid 19 without any injection. One week after the discovery, the Japanese lab was purchased and everything shut down. Interesting.\nIn 2022 the farm lost about 60 ostriches to a rare bacterial infection. But an amazing thing happened: they stopped dying and within a month, nothing was dying and all the droopy birds looked robust and healthy. Tissue samples confirmed that it was njot bird flu. Some 300 wild mallard ducks virtually live at the farm.\nThis past December, two ostriches died and an “anonymous informant” called the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to report a possible bird flu situation. Officials came, ran a PCR test on the carcasses that were 48 hours old, and discovered bird flu. Immediately the government put the farm under quarantine and demanded extermination of all the remaining 300 ostriches.\nBecause this farm has connections in the research community, it sent blood samples of the birds to a lab. Guess what? All the birds had antigens to bird flu. In fact, Katie, the farm owner, is carrying bird flu antigens in HER blood. The government didn’t like this testing, and threatened a $200,000 fine if they tested any more animals.\nAn extermination order Dec. 27, demanding that the farm kill all the antigen-carrying, healthy birds, demanded immediate responses. One option was to qualify for a “distinct unit exemption package.” Because the paperwork was written for commercial poultry operations, none of it applied to this special ostrich place. A “no” in any box meant automatic denial.\nRight now Katie and Connie and friends are desperate to save their birds. They’ve filed an injunction in the courts that will be heard April 15 and 16. The Judicial Review will determine if the Dec. 27 cull order can be overturned and to determine if an exemption request has merit.\nA tidbit that’s too strange to omit is that the main CFIA agent in charge of the case is “Case Worker 007.” You can’t make this stuff up.\nConnie’s sleuthing has turned up an interesting thing about the one Canadian farm that has received the unique exemption, meaning even with bird flu, they don’t have to kill the surviving healthy birds. Only one farm has ever been granted an exemption from bird flu extermination: Hybrid Turkey Farms on Mar. 27, 2022. It’s owned by Hendrix Genetics from the Netherlands. Remember my post from a few days ago noting that the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands was one of the 3 labs doing gain-of-function research on bird flu, according to Dr. Peter McCullough.\nWho owns Hendrix? Paine Schwartz Partnership, which lists the Canadian Government as a partner. This outfit is doing Turkey Trac development, which injects trackers into eggs so a bird can be monitored for its whole life. Some 90 percent of turkeys eaten on Canadian tables come from Hendrix. What happens when you eat these tracking devices? Can someone track you?\nCFIA officials have told Katie, the ostrich farmer “every outdoor animal poses a risk because it’s exposed to migratory birds.” The ostrich farm has been completely bird flu symptom free now for 90 days and counting. The birds have the antigens. They’re healthy. But the government agents have one goal: kill everything.\nOn the zoom calls with me, Katie sobs for her birds and the stress she’s under. What’s crazy is that as soon as all their birds are killed, they can repopulate with new birds, according to the government. “What are they going to do about the 300 mallard ducks?” Katie asks. Nothing, of course. The CFIA agents laugh at the question, she notes.\nFolks, this is outrageous. Here we have documented examples of immunological adaptation and nature’s antigen wisdom, but government agents show positive symptoms for insanity. I’m relaying this story to the best of my ability the way Katie the farmer told it to me. My heart breaks for her and I told her I would try to get her story out to a wider audience. Have mercy.\nIf you want to help Katie hang onto her birds and farm, you can do it by going to www.saveourostriches.com.\nWhat would you do if government agents told you to kill your healthy birds?\nShare This Story:\nFacebook\n\"Bird Flu, Have Mercy\" Joel Salatin on our farm...","markdown":"# Bird Flu, Have Mercy - by Joel Salatin\n\n[![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-3.png)](https://www.thelunaticfarmer.com/)\n\nArticle by [**Joel Salatin, the Lunatic Farmer**](https://www.thelunaticfarmer.com/blog/4/3/2025/bird-flu-have-mercy)\n\n**Apr 3, 2025** – My post today originates form Edgewood, British Columbia, where Universal Ostrich Farms faces a Canadian government assault on their 300 healthy ostriches.  Farm owner Katie Pasitney and her friend and sleuth Connie Shields have quite a tragic story.  I’ve had two lengthy conversations with them and here is a synopsis of their plight.\n\nThe 400-ostrich farm switched from meat and eggs  three years ago to a research facility collaborating with a Japanese scientist trying to develop covid 19 antigens.  Their experiments yielded robust antigens in the egg yolks that were processed into nutraceuticals administered as a pill, lozenge, or nasal spray.  It totally neutralized covid 19 without any injection.  One week after the discovery, the Japanese lab was purchased and everything shut down.

Most important were the statements made by CFIA “experts” involving the identified variant of Avian flu, found by the testing. CFIA experts admitted during the discovery process that they weren’t qualified to respond to questions about the variants transmission.\nUpdate #3\nJust before the morning break, lawyer Lee Turner took over from Michael Carter.\nMr. Turner turned the focus onto how the CFIA failed to properly address the new emerging variant.\nUsing the World Health Organization Animals (WHOA) directives to member countries on what should be done it was obvious that the CFIA didn’t follow the directives.\nAs Canada follows and relies on WHOA, Mr. Turned used their definition of “poultry” to demonstrate to the judge that these ostriches did not fall into the guidelines associated with poultry.\nMorning break.\nUpdate #4\n11:26 am court resumes after morning break. Lee Turner describes for the court how negligent the CFIA was in dealing with the new variant.\nReferring to CFIA’s own vet, Cathy Furness, affidavit where she acknowledges that the test results from the 2 dead ostriches showed a unique reassortment of genome type not identified before in Canada, Mr. Turner again detailed what the CFIAs responsibilities were and that they failed to meet those requirements. Including testing, monitoring and research.\nUpdate 5\nLawyer Lee Turner took time to address Justice Zinn’s earlier questions about expert witnesses, qualifications and concerns about one of CFIAs affiants who made statements of opinion without being qualified as an expert.\nSome exchanges with the Justice and referenced discussion regarding precedent cases.\nMichael Carter will be back presenting after the lunch break.\nCourt will resume at 1:20 pm\nUpdate 6\nThe judicial review hearings continues. Lawyer Michael Carter, raises the numerous flaws in the CFIA decision making. With regard to the December 31, 2024 cull order the evidence shows that the decision by CFIA was “fatally flawed.”\nReferring to the sworn affidavits by CFIA it is clear that CFIA agents making the decisions didn’t have all the information! Dr. Fuentes’s confirms the only information they relied upon was the lab report from Abbotsford.\nUpdate 7\nLawyer Michael Carter navigates the mixed orders fiasco with Justice Zinn.\nOn Jan 2, 2025, CFIA gives the ostrich farm an exemption based on the valuable and rare genetics the ostriches possess. CFIA asks the owners to provide more information. CFIA doesn’t inform owners what info they need and gives them a form that is used for a commercial poultry farm. This firm isn’t applicable to the ostrich farm.\nOn January 10, the farm owners are then informed that their exemption has been REVOKED! No explanation, just orders to kill the ostriches by Feb 1.\nCarter also informs the court that CFIA has a policy of being transparent but failed to provide information as to why they changed their decision about the rare and valuable gentics.\nJustice Zinn is engaged. Doesn’t miss a word, including ones that are mis-spoken.\nUpdate 8\nCourt is over for today\nLawyer Michael Carter finished his submissions by informing the judge that the CFIA has discretion. Decision should be flexible, reflect scientific considerations…\nDiscussion then turned to vaccinations and both CFIA and WHOA agree that immunity is the goal.\nIssues around trade agreements clearly reflected that CFIAs reliance on using trade as an affected aspect was bogus. The CFIAs affiant swore that he had no knowledge of any trade deals being broken due to Avian flu.\n“CFIA’s statement that trade is affected is not true.”\nCarter finished his submissions and the taxpayer funded CFIA lawyer began her submissions calling the definition if poultry and the low pathogen designation a “Red Herring”.\nJudge questioned her on how she got to the designation of the tested virus being “highly pathogenic?” She responded by referring to a number of statements that didn’t make it “crystal clear.”\nDiscussions around the poultry designations also included what was happening at the farm and if it exceeded “research”.\nCourt ended with more to come tomorrow morning at 9:30 am.\nShare This Story\nFacebook \n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSaveOurOstriches%2Fvideos%2F1226548435725063%2F%3Fref%3Dembed_video&show_text=0&width=267\" width=\"267\" height=\"476\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe>\nLearn more about embedding Facebook videos on our developer site.\nVideo Unavailable\nSorry, this video could not be played.","markdown":"# April 15, 2025 - Judicial Review Update (Day 1)\n\n**Katie Pasitney from Universal Ostrich Farms**\n\nDay 1 of the Judicial Review @ 701 West Georgia Street, Vancouver BC.\n\nKatie provides an update from Federal Court, where the case of Universal Ostrich Farms against the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is underway.\n\n> Good morning everybody.

The farm, which has been raising ostriches for 35 years, is facing a crisis due to a government order to cull over 400 ostriches amid an avian flu outbreak, despite most birds showing resistance and antibodies to the virus.\nKatie explains that the farm has shifted focus in recent years to groundbreaking antibody research in collaboration with Kyoto Prefectural University in Japan. They inoculate ostriches with antigens to produce robust antibodies in their egg yolks, which could be used to create nutraceuticals like lozenges and nasal sprays to boost human immunity against diseases, including COVID-19 variants. This research has shown promising results, with one ostrich egg containing antibodies equivalent to 100 chicken eggs or the blood of 800 rabbits, offering a humane and efficient alternative.\nThe crisis began in December 2024 when the farm noticed symptoms similar to a 2020 pseudomonas bacteria outbreak, initially linked to migratory mallard ducks. However, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), acting on an anonymous tip, tested two deceased ostriches and confirmed H5N1 avian influenza using PCR tests, rejecting the farm’s request to test healthy birds or conduct a broader study. Despite the farm’s isolation and the ostriches’ apparent herd immunity—evidenced by 76 days without symptomatic deaths post-quarantine—the CFIA ordered the entire flock’s destruction, citing trading partner policies influenced by the World Health Organization and the UN.\nKatie highlights the farm’s struggle against what she calls a “stamping out” policy that prioritizes mass culling over preserving natural immunity, potentially benefiting Big Pharma by eliminating alternatives to vaccines. The CFIA has threatened a $250,000 fine or jail time if the farm tests its own animals, and even probed for intellectual property during a 5.5-hour meeting, despite having already signed a kill order on December 30, 2024. The family faces a deadline to kill and bury the ostriches themselves or lose compensation if a third-party contractor intervenes.\nWith a judicial review scheduled for mid-April, the farm is fighting legally to save their ostriches and research, having raised over $60,000 for legal fees but facing $100,000 more in outstanding costs. Katie pleads for public support, emphasizing the global implications for agriculture and natural immunity, and directs listeners to saveourostiches.com for updates and donations.\nChrissy underscores the story’s urgency, calling for action against government overreach and the preservation of this potentially revolutionary science, urging listeners to share the episode and support the cause.\nLearn more about this cause at https://bcrising.ca/save-our-ostriches/ and give to the cause at https://www.givesendgo.com/save-our-ostriches or https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ostrich-farmers-fight-to-save-herd-from-avian-flu\nShare This Story:\nTwitter Embed\nImagine a world where a family farm’s 400 ostriches—resilient, healthy & key to revolutionary antibody research—are ordered to be destroyed despite showing natural immunity to avian flu.

Katie pleads for public support, emphasizing the global implications for agriculture and natural immunity, and directs listeners to [saveourostiches.com](http://saveourostiches.com/) for updates and donations.\n\nChrissy underscores the story’s urgency, calling for action against government overreach and the preservation of this potentially revolutionary science, urging listeners to share the episode and support the cause.\n\nLearn more about this cause at [https://bcrising.ca/save-our-ostriches/](https://bcrising.ca/save-our-ostriches/) and give to the cause at [https://www.givesendgo.com/save-our-ostriches](https://www.givesendgo.com/save-our-ostriches) or [https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ostrich-farmers-fight-to-save-herd-from-avian-flu](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ostrich-farmers-fight-to-save-herd-from-avian-flu?attribution_id=sl%3A80e09934-7413-429b-acfb-2f7015cc19d3&lang=en_CA)\n\n## Share This Story:\n\nTwitter Embed\n\n[](https://twitter.com/NorthAmericaAg/status/1907804536409903424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1907804536409903424%7Ctwgr%5Ea142992026d80f7f5589d964488bf3251d50c0df%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsaveourostriches.com%2Fpodcasts%2Fostrich-antibodies-avian-flu-is-science-being-ignored%2F)\n\nImagine a world where a family farm’s 400 ostriches—resilient, healthy & key to revolutionary antibody research—are ordered to be destroyed despite showing natural immunity to avian flu.

This drastic action was ordered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in the wake of the ongoing “Avian Flu” hysteria.\nLegal Update\nOn February 17, 2025, Justice Michael Battista of the Federal Court of Canada issued a ruling in response to motions filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) seeking clarification of his January 31, 2025, Stay Order. Justice Battista affirmed that his initial decision was in line with the law and that CFIA had failed to present any new information or overlooked key aspects. In his February 17 decision, Justice Battista emphasized, “The Stay Order reflects the Court’s intention,” and concluded, “There is no ambiguity in the Stay Order. It clearly stayed the operation of the Respondent’s Notice dated December 31, 2024, until a decision is rendered in the underlying application for judicial review.” In short: CFIA, you cannot kill the ostriches until the judicial review is heard and decided.\nBackground and Timeline\nIn late December 2024, a large flock of wild ducks landed on a pond shared by over 450 ostriches on Universal Ostrich Farm in Edgewood. Over the following two weeks, some of the ostriches became sick, and 67 died. A similar event occurred on the farm in 2020, where a small number of ostriches fell ill and died, but the cause was identified as an opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas, not Avian Flu. With guidance from their vet, the family treated the birds, and the sick ones recovered.\nConcerned by the onset of similar symptoms, farm owners Karen Espersen and Dave Balinski contacted their vet, but he was unavailable due to the Christmas holiday. They began treating the affected ostriches as they did in 2020, and the birds began to recover.\nOn December 30, 2024, CFIA agents arrived at the farm, tested two dead carcasses, but did not perform autopsies or take tissue samples. They only swabbed the two dead birds for PCR testing, which only tests for Avian Flu, neglecting other potential pathogens like Pseudomonas. The following day, CFIA informed the farm owners that the birds tested positive for Avian Flu and issued a “kill order” for all 400 remaining ostriches.\nDespite sharing their scientific research demonstrating the ostriches’ robust immunity and potential to develop antibodies, including those that may combat COVID-related illnesses, the farm owners’ pleas to CFIA fell on deaf ears. On January 10, 2025, CFIA reaffirmed the kill order, demanding the birds be slaughtered by February 1, 2025.\nLegal and Scientific Standpoint\nThe farm owners reached out to stakeholders and the public for help. They retained Michael Carter, of the law firm Cleveland Doan, on January 22, 2025, who, along with other lawyers, experts, scientists, and veterinarians, worked tirelessly to challenge the CFIA’s decision to kill the ostriches. Appearing in the Federal Court of Canada, on January 31, 2025, Justice Battista granted a Stay of Execution to prevent the mass slaughter. A global team of scientists rallied behind the ostriches, recognizing their potential not only as a source of natural immunity against avian flu but the opportunity to have a living laboratory to study “best immunity” strategies, and antibody science.\nLawyers for the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed two motions four days later: one to expedite the judicial review hearing, and the other seeking clarification of Justice Battista’s Stay Order. The CFIA argued that the injunction applied only to the farm owners, preventing them from killing the 400 ostriches. They sought clarification that the order would permit the CFIA to proceed with the kill. To further complicate matters and impose additional legal costs on the family, the CFIA also filed an appeal of the Stay Order.\nOn February 18, 2025, Justice Battista ruled on these motions, affirming that the Stay Order remains in effect — meaning no ostriches are to be killed until the judicial review is heard. Justice Battista also agreed to expedite the review, as requested by the CFIA. He appointed a case management judge to oversee the scheduling, with deadlines for document exchanges and a tentative hearing date set for a two-day judicial review from April 14-17, 2025, in the Federal Court of Canada.\nKatie Pasitnay, spokesperson for Universal Ostrich Farm, stated:\n“This is not just about saving 400 birds. It’s about science, public health, and the government’s failure to embrace logic over outdated policies. We are fighting to protect these animals, the valuable research they represent, and the rights of the family who has dedicated years of effort to their care.”\nKey Facts:\nLast ostrich death: January 14, 2025 (more than 40 days ago).\nAvian Flu incubation: CFIA states it has a 14-day maximum incubation period.\nThe sick ostriches have fully recovered.\nNearly 90% of the herd remains unaffected.\nThe ostriches now have natural immunity and should be used to breed avian flu-resistant ostriches and further research into antibodies.\nYet, the CFIA insists on eradicating these genetically valuable birds instead of recognizing their immunity as a potential asset for future vaccine development.\nUpcoming Court Dates:\nAs the case continues, support for Universal Ostrich Farm and the scientific community’s calls for the preservation of these birds grows. The outcome of the judicial review will be a pivotal moment in determining the future of these ostriches, if they have one, and the role they may play in global health research.\nThe date for the hearing of the appeal has not been set.\nFor media inquiries or to show support, please submit all requests to:\nKatie Pasitney, Universal Ostrich Farm spokeswoman – Katie is the daughter of Karen Espersen, one of the owners of Universal Ostriches and has become the public face of this battle appearing on numerous talk shows across Canada and the United States.

If they don’t cull them, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will.\nThe ordeal began in December 2024 when an anonymous person tipped off the CFIA that there was illness at the Universal Ostrich Farms. Some of the ostriches were sick, but the illness had run its course.\nThe farm was contacted by the CFIA and agreed to allow them to come test their ostriches. When the CFIA arrived with PCR tests to test 2 dead ostriches. The farmers asked if they were going to test the live ostriches, as a control group.\nThe CFIA came out with PCR tests and tested two dead ostriches. The farmers requested that they also test two live ostriches. They believed it was a reasonable approach to better understanding the illness, by using healthy ostriches as the “control group.”\nHowever, CFIA refused to test the live birds. They conducted the tests and called the next day to inform them that the two dead ostriches had tested positive for H5N1. As a result, the CFIA ordered them to quarantine their ostriches and cull the entire herd by February 1, 2025. If the farmers did not comply, the CFIA threatened to send someone to cull the ostriches instead.\nThese are non-commercial ostriches, are not sold for meat, and are flightless. They live on a remote farm where the likelihood of infecting another animal is extremely low. The ostriches that naturally die are harvested for oil, feathers, and skin. So why would the CFIA insist on culling a herd that could naturally reach immunity?\nUniversal Ostrich Farms has been operational since 1995, and these ostriches, which can live up to 75 years, are part of an international program involving three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Japan. The ostriches have been integral in providing high-quality antibodies that have been successfully extracted from ostrich eggs which can be used to produce effective treatments for various diseases. \nIn a 2022 social media post, the government of Japan stated, “High-quality antibodies have been successfully extracted from ostrich eggs by Kyoto Prefectural University president Dr. Tsukamoto. Ostriches are hardy animals with strong immune systems, and at 1/4000 the cost of antibodies from other animals, their high-quality antibodies are easier to mass-produce, meaning they may show the way forward for the modern world.”\nGiven these promising prospects, why would the CFIA insist on culling this herd, which could potentially contribute to the eradication of diseases with their antibodies? Wouldn’t they want to preserve the valuable science and research that have been established with these ostriches?\nOn January 31st, a federal judge, Justice Battista issued a “stay” on the culling, giving the farmers time to seek a judicial review. On February 6, CFIA added 19 additional measures to the quarantine order. \nAs of February 19, 2025, the ostriches have gone 35 days without illness or death, remain in good health, and have achieved herd immunity.\nTheir case is scheduled for a judicial review within 10 days. Speaking with Katie, she urges the public “Help us save our animals, so we can help protect yours”. This is a tragedy not just for Katie and her family at Universal Ostrich Farms, but on humanity, as it threatens the loss of critical scientific progress.\nTo see the recent interview with Katie and an update on the legal battle check out the interview with Colonel MacGregor at Our Country Our Choice.\nIf you would like to help by lending your voice or contributing financially, please visit SaveOurOstriches.com \nUrgent call: Save the Ostriches!! - YouTube\nShare This Story:\nTwitter Embed\nBREAKING: Canadian Government orders the k-lling of 400 Ostriches after refusing to test live birds.

If the farmers did not comply, the CFIA threatened to send someone to cull the ostriches instead.\n\nThese are non-commercial ostriches, are not sold for meat, and are flightless. They live on a remote farm where the likelihood of infecting another animal is extremely low. The ostriches that naturally die are harvested for oil, feathers, and skin. So why would the CFIA insist on culling a herd that could naturally reach immunity?\n\nUniversal Ostrich Farms has been operational since 1995, and these ostriches, which can live up to 75 years, are part of an international program involving three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Japan. The ostriches have been integral in providing high-quality antibodies that have been successfully extracted from ostrich eggs which can be used to produce effective treatments for various diseases.   \n\nIn a 2022 social media post, the government of Japan stated, “High-quality antibodies have been successfully extracted from ostrich eggs by Kyoto Prefectural University president Dr. Tsukamoto. Ostriches are hardy animals with strong immune systems, and at 1/4000 the cost of antibodies from other animals, their high-quality antibodies are easier to mass-produce, meaning they may show the way forward for the modern world.”\n\nGiven these promising prospects, why would the CFIA insist on culling this herd, which could potentially contribute to the eradication of diseases with their antibodies? Wouldn’t they want to preserve the valuable science and research that have been established with these ostriches?\n\nOn January 31st, a federal judge, Justice Battista issued a “stay” on the culling, giving the farmers time to seek a judicial review. On February 6, CFIA added 19 additional measures to the quarantine order. \n\nAs of February 19, 2025, the ostriches have gone 35 days without illness or death, remain in good health, and have achieved herd immunity.\n\nTheir case is scheduled for a judicial review within 10 days. Speaking with Katie, she urges the public “Help us save our animals, so we can help protect yours”. This is a tragedy not just for Katie and her family at Universal Ostrich Farms, but on humanity, as it threatens the loss of critical scientific progress.\n\nTo see the recent interview with Katie and an update on the legal battle check out the interview with Colonel MacGregor at [Our Country Our Choice.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDhEBwCbAM)\n\nIf you would like to help by lending your voice or contributing financially, please visit [SaveOurOstriches.com](https://bcrising.ca/save-our-ostriches/) \n\nUrgent call: Save the Ostriches!! - YouTube\n\n[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeDhEBwCbAM&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fsaveourostriches.com%2F)\n\n## Share This Story:\n\nTwitter Embed\n\n[](https://twitter.com/DougAMacgregor/status/1892674201825280319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1892674201825280319%7Ctwgr%5E6a5690ec939e0f02f38677df8bece5a5f53266ec%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsaveourostriches.com%2Fnews%2Fcanadian-govt-orders-killing-400-ostriches%2F)\n\nBREAKING: Canadian Government orders the k-lling of 400 Ostriches after refusing to test live birds.

This is not science—it’s cruelty wrapped in red tape.”​\n“They are not stamping out a virus. They are stamping out natural immunity. They don’t want people to realize that survival is possible,”​ said Katie Pasitney, Karen Esperson’s daughter.\nThe CFIA doesn’t have the resources to slaughter and dispose of 400 ostriches, so they want hunters to kill these majestic birds for them.\nAn internal CFIA discussion leaked to Universal Ostrich Farms posed the question, “Can we get hunters to kill these birds for us?”\nCFIA’s desire to ask third parties to kill 400 ostriches on CFIA’s behalf is corroborated by their appeal of the emergency injunction stopping the slaughter. CFIA asserts that the injunction applies only to the owners of Universal Ostrich Farms, and not to CFIA or agents acting on its behalf.[ii]\nNo, CFIA, we will not do your dirty work for you\nHunters are ethical men and women who humanely harvest wildlife to feed their families. They are not contract killers for government agencies.\nCFIA has no evidence that the 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms are sick. CFIA performed PCR tests on two dead birds after 16 hours – not by conducting an autopsy or taking tissue samples, the “gold standard” in testing – and used PCR tests to rationalize killing this entire flock of majestic birds.\nThe ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms are not used for human consumption. They are research birds, crucial to a groundbreaking collaboration with Japan’s Kyoto Prefectural University, where the university’s president, Dr. Yasuhiro Tsukamoto, has successfully extracted antibodies from the birds’ eggs in an effort to create a vaccination against avian flu.[iii]\nA Warning To Anyone Considering Killing Ostriches on CFIA’s Behalf\nThis is not a fight that any regular citizen wants to get involved with. \nThere are serious criminal penalties for injuring, endangering or killing animals or birds, as well as for discharging firearms where that activity is prohibited.\nCriminal Code section 445.1 (1) deals with injuring or endangering animals.[iv]\nEvery one commits an offence who\nwilfully causes or, being the owner, wilfully permits to be caused unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to an animal or a bird;\n[deleted]\nwilfully, without reasonable excuse, administers a poisonous or an injurious drug or substance to a domestic animal or bird or an animal or a bird wild by nature that is kept in captivity or, being the owner of such an animal or a bird, wilfully permits a poisonous or an injurious drug or substance to be administered to it;\nBritish Columbia’s hunting regulations state\nIt’s unlawful to hunt or discharge a firearm within 100 metres of a church, school building, school yard, playground, regional district park, dwelling house, or farm or ranch building that is occupied by persons or domestic animals.[v]\nIt is also unlawful to discharge a firearm across or to discharge a firearm or hunt within the road allowances of any two lane public road in B.C.[vi]\nCSSA denounces CFIA’s belief it can turn ethical hunters into “government contract killers”.\nCSSA also call on our friends at the National Firearms Association and Canadian Coalition for Firearms Rights to join us in denouncing the CFIA’s actions in this case.\nBeyond The Headline\nThe Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) ordered the owners of Universal Ostrich Farms to kill their entire herd of 400 ostriches.\n“We asked if we could independently test our birds, and they said no,” explained Karen Espersen, co-owner of Universal Ostrich Farms. “We asked if we could quarantine. They said no. We asked if we could vaccinate. They said no. They don’t want solutions, they want a cull.”\nCFIA opposed independent testing so vehemently that they threatened Universal Ostrich Farms with penalties of 6 months in jail and/or a $200,000 fine for each independent test.\nThat’s not the actions of a government agency seeking the truth. Those are the actions of a government agency intent on killing an entire flock of ostriches even if those birds are 100% healthy.\n“Saving the ostriches has united the ethical scientific community and the concerned voices of people across the globe. These big, beautiful birds have shifted the conversation on science and are now bringing truth to it,” Kari Simpson says.\nDownload the Timeline of Events here: https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CSSA/PDF/Ostrich/Universal-Ostrich-Farms-Detailed-Timeline-of-Events.pdf\nIN DETAIL: Why the Cull Order is Unjustified and Problematic\n1. Lack of Proper Testing and Scientific Rigor\nThe only evidence CFIA used to justify the cull was two positive throat swabs from already dead birds​.\nGold standard testing for Avian Influenza requires tissue sampling and full necropsies—neither of which were conducted.\nThe farm experienced Pseudomonas infections in 2020, which present similar symptoms to Avian Influenza​.\nWithout proper tissue tests, the CFIA cannot conclusively determine that H5N1 caused the ostrich deaths.\n2. Ostriches Had Developed Natural Immunity\nThe farm initially suffered some deaths, but the remaining ostriches recovered​.\nScientific research from Kyoto Prefectural University in Japan shows ostriches can generate antibodies against various diseases, including COVID-19​.\nIf the herd developed natural immunity, these birds could hold valuable genetic insights for disease resistance.\nDestroying a naturally immune flock is counterproductive to scientific advancements in avian disease mitigation.\n3. CFIA’s “Stamping Out” Policy is Outdated and Harmful\nCFIA follows a “stamping out” policy, which requires culling all birds on infected premises.\nCFIA’s “stamping out” policy cannot prevent infected wild bird populations, like mallard ducks, from infecting farm birds like ostriches, chickens, and turkeys.\nThe World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) allows alternative strategies, such as controlled quarantine and vaccination​.\nMany other countries have opted for vaccination programs instead of mass culling.\n4. Economic and Ethical Devastation\nUniversal Ostrich Farms is a 25-year-old business with a unique genetic breeding program​.\nDestroying the flock would result in irreversible genetic loss, damaging future research and breeding efforts.\nThe cull order violates basic animal welfare principles, as the ostriches are healthy and show no signs of illness.\nThe public backlash against this order is enormous, with thousands supporting the farm’s legal battle​.\n5. Legal and Political Overreach\nThe Canadian government is prioritizing trade relationships over ethical animal management.\nThe Premises ID Program and traceability laws grant excessive power to the government over private livestock ownership​.\nCFIA’s inconsistent application of regulations (e.g., revoking “distinct unit” status without explanation) raises serious concerns about due process​.\n6. Government is Wrong to Order the Cull\nScientific failure – CFIA did not conduct proper necropsies before ordering mass slaughter.\nNatural immunity ignored – The herd likely developed resistance to the disease, which is scientifically valuable.\nAlternative solutions exist – Countries like France and Japan use vaccinations instead of mass culling.\nDevastating economic impact – The farm will be permanently destroyed if the cull proceeds.\nLegal overreach – CFIA’s decision violates the principles of fair administrative action.\nThis case is a prime example of government overreach, bad science, and bureaucratic negligence. Instead of executing a flawed mass cull, CFIA should adopt modern disease management strategies and respect farmers’ rights.\n[i] https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CSSA/PDF/Ostrich/Cull-Order-Dec-31-2024.pdf\n[ii] https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CSSA/PDF/Ostrich/UOF-v-CFIA—T-294-25—Order-Final-311.pdf\n[iii] https://www.rebelnews.com/save_the_ostriches\n[iv] https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-445.1.html\n[v] https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/sports-recreation-arts-and-culture/outdoor-recreation/fishing-and-hunting/hunting/regulations/hunting-trapping-synopsis.pdf, Page 12\n[vi] ibid\nShare this Story:\nFacebook\nNO CFIA, HUNTERS ARE NOT YOUR EXECUTIONERS\nThe Canadian Shooting Sports Association stands firmly against the CFIA's desperate attempt to recruit hunters for their unjustified ostrich cull in BC.\nThese 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms are research animals helping develop vaccines against avian flu.

What is the goal here? To save healthy animals from an inhumane and unjustified death.\nOur shared mission is simple and powerful: to protect healthy animals, and ultimately people, from an unnecessary, inhumane fate. Let’s rise above the noise of accusations and focus on the real questions that deserve thoughtful answers. Farmers are juggling biosecurity measures, animal care, community concerns and so much more – this isn’t about avoiding hard conversations, it’s about supporting those who work tirelessly as farmers and for what is right.\nIf you read something you are not sure of or need clarification, please first refer to this living document at SaveOurOstriches.com. If questions still linger, feel free to email SaveOurOstriches@gmail.com before sharing possibly inaccurate information.\nAsking questions is much more productive than sharing unverified and misunderstood portions of information. Please consider that sharing false information and statements can be considered defamation, will damage the farm’s reputation and increase our farm’s exposure to harm.\nWhen we choose collaboration over conflict we are stopping ‘shaking the ants’ actions, and instead forging a stronger, kinder and united future for our animals, farmers, and community.\nOfficial Statement from Universal Ostrich Farms Inc.\nMay 21, 2025\nBackground \nFor over 30 years, business partners Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski have upheld the highest standards in animal welfare and scientific integrity. Below, we clarify our history, practices, and recent challenges to address misinformation and affirm our dedication to transparency. \nFounding and Operations: Incorporated in 2001, Universal Ostrich Farms Inc., led by Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski, has ethically raised ostriches for three decades with a focus on ethical breeding and care. \nStruthio Bioscience Inc: Launched in May 2022, this division partnered with Dr. Tsukamoto of Kyoto University to develop and purify ostrich-derived antibodies (IgY) for research and therapeutic applications. \nMission: To advance sustainable farming and contribute to scientific progress through safe, non-invasive antibody production. \nAntigen Research vs. Vaccination \nAntigen Exposure: In our projects we used only non-infectious antigens to stimulate antibody production in laying hens’ egg yolks while doing research. This is a standard process that is being used in natural avian antibody production. These fragments cannot cause disease. Antibodies are safely harvested from egg yolks without harming the birds. \nTerminology Clarified: \nInoculation – The deliberate introduction of a pure antigen (by injection or any way of entry to the body), without any additional substances, to induce immunity and antibody production. \nAntigen exposure – Is not a vaccine. It uses non-infectious fragments to prime immunity. \nVaccination – The process of administration of a vaccine. \nVaccine – A substance that contains disease causing preparation of killed, weakened, or part of a microorganism, as well as adjuvants, preservatives, and chemicals, to stimulate the immune system to protect against disease in the future. \nImmunization – The broad term for any process (natural or artificial) that readies the immune system to fight a potential invader. It represents both vaccination and inoculation processes. \nSafety: Our antigen exposure process is distinct from vaccination, using ostriches’ natural immune systems. We do NOT produce antibodies with live viruses or mRNA. \nFarm Operations and Health History \nCurrent Focus: Since 2020, we have focused on breeding, antibody research, and supporting new farmers that want to get into the agriculture industry. Meat processing ceased in the summer of 2019. \n2020 Pseudomonas Outbreak: In March 2020, a diagnosis of Pseudomonas bacterial infection confirmed by a lab and veterinarian, affected ≈3% of birds (10 birds total) with survivors developing natural and eventual herd immunity. No further outbreaks or disease occurred until December 2024. \nBird Sales: In June 2021, six birds (neither injected with antigens nor offspring of injected hens) were sold for breeding, not food, as breeders are too valuable for slaughter. No injected birds entered the food chain. \nCOVID-19 Antibody Research (2020–2021) \nCollaboration: Periods in April to October in both 2020 and 2021, we contracted out Immune BioSolutions for them to provide an antigen, which has been historically given to chickens, and to extract and purify the Universal Ostrich Farm antibodies under regular common non-disclosure confidentiality clauses on COVID-19 antibody research. Separately, Immune BioSolutions received a $13.44 Million grant from the Canadian government for their own work. Universal Ostrich Farms and Struthio BioScience did not receive any payment, funding or benefit from Immune BioSolutions nor directly from the Government. Instead, the farm’s contract was abruptly terminated, without any reason presented to the farm.\nAntigen Use: Immune BioSolutions provided pre-tested antigens to stimulate antibodies in hens (not roosters). These were 98% effective at neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19 and its variants, with ostrich antibodies outperforming chicken antibodies by 30–40%. \nProject Termination: The contract with the farm abruptly halted as mentioned above, with no reasons provided. Immune BioSolutions retained some of the farm’s most effective antibodies. Again, no payments came to the farm from Immune BioSolutions. \nJapanese Research \nJapanese Collaboration: Unrelated to Universal Ostrich Farm, Dr. Tsukamoto, a Japanese government-funded Kyoto University president, tested Covid-19 antibody-infused mask liners in Japan. This was Tsukamoto’s OWN research with his own ostriches, as he has his own farm. He offered H5N1 antibodies to the Canadian government in 2025, receiving no response. Universal Ostrich Farm did not produce or sell masks and have no ties to the World Economic Forum (WEF). What, if any, affiliations that Dr. Tsukamoto may have with WEF is unknown to us and our farm. \nDecember 2024–January 2025 Health Events \nInitial Case: On December 10, 2024, a 3-year-old ostrich hen developed pneumonia-like symptoms, presenting the same symptoms as 2020 (see above). This hen was treated using the same protocols prescribed by the vet in 2020. The hen fully recovered and is alive and well today. \nOutbreak: From December 14, 2024, to January 14, 2025, 69 young male and female breeders died, most of them under four years old. These young breeders were born or acquired after 2020, therefore they were lacking the 2020 Pseudomonas immunity. The 69 died over 31 days (~2/day). Each sick bird was immediately quarantined and many recovered with treatments. \nDistinction from HPAI: Unlike High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which is said to kill entire avian flocks in 24 hours, this farm’s illness resulted in only approximately 15% of deaths which occurred over 31 days as it slowly ran its course until reaching full herd immunity on January 14th. According to CFIA lab documents, this illness involves a new hybrid of Low Pathogenic (LPAI) and High Pathogenic (HPAI) Avian Influenza, confirmed by PCR testing done by CFIA, in their internal and self-regulated labs. The LPAI portion of this hybrid is important in indicating that this illness is much less deadly, as per CFIA. \nCFIA Testing and Cull Order \nCFIA Involvement: Following an anonymous tip on December 28th , 2024, CFIA called the farm and agreed, based on symptoms, this did not sound like avian influenza. CFIA told the farm to call when they had 2 new carcasses available for testing. On December 29th , the farm called CFIA as there were 2 more deaths. \nCFIA tested the two carcasses on December 30, 2024, with preliminary H5 results from an internal self-regulated CFIA/Ministry of Agriculture lab in Abbotsford, BC. A cull order was signed and issued 41 minutes after the PCR test results were known, before N1 confirmation from the Winnipeg internal self-regulated CFIA lab results were known on January 10, 2025.\nNo details of the testing, handling, and shipment of the test samples have been disclosed, even upon multiple requests by the farm. This chain of custody is normally provided to ensure proper procedures are followed to avoid flawed results. Additionally, CFIA orders state that NO testing, including third party testing can be done. In fact, the farm is under order that they cannot treat or test their own animals, which the farm normally does themselves. \nTesting Restrictions: Independent “gold-standard” tissue testing and any other testing of any kind is prohibited, with threats of $200,000 fines and/or six months in jail for conducting our own tests, as per Health of Animals Act Section 66.b. Thus, only PCR testing was done by CFIA on two carcasses. It is commonly believed that PCR testing is limited and contradictory. PCR is not the gold standard testing method and is not recommended as a diagnostic tool. \nExemption and Rejection: A “rare genetics” exemption was promised by a CFIA officer in writing on January 2, 2025 but was rejected 8 days later, on January 10, In a CFIA “Distinct Unit Package” exemption request form. The farm was told if any answers were NO that they would immediately get denied an exemption. BUT, the form was intended for commercial poultry thus nothing on the form was relevant for a non-commercial Ostrich farm. \nLegal Actions and Court Outcomes \nInjunction: On January 31, 2025 Universal Ostrich farm won an injunction to pause a February 1 cull order, compelling CFIA to justify its decision via Judicial Review based limited to only data known from December 31, 2024, to January 10, 2025.\nJudicial Review: On April 15–16, 2025, a Federal Court in Vancouver reviewed all evidence pertaining to the Notice to Dispose Order issued on December 31st, 2024 and the Exemption Denial dated January 10th, 2025. The Judgement and Reasons were posted on May 13, 2025, exactly 27 days after the hearing ended. Under administrative law, Justice Zinn’s hands were tied.\nAs Judge Zinn quoted in his decision in Paragraph 3:\n“This is not an appeal. The Court is not stepping into the shoes of the Agency and making the decisions that the Court feels ought to have been made. Instead, the focus of the review is on the Agency’s reasoning and process.” \nContinuing to Paragraph 5: \n“Courts must respect Parliament’s choice to assign decision-making power to administrative bodies. This respect comes from the principle of separation of powers a cornerstone of Canadian public law” \nThe Judge couldn’t consider anything after January 10th , including the fact that Universal Ostrich Farm has had no illness or deaths since January 14, 2025. \nAs the Judge revealed, it was not within his power to determine what was right or wrong. The court’s rule was limited to whether the CFIA exercised their policies and acted within reasonable fairness. It is the CFIA’s policies that need to be challenged and changed, and that cannot be done in a judicial review. A separate action needs to be filed for this. \nRDCK Statement: On May 15, 2025, supported by intense public pressure, the Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) voted unanimously that CFIA test all healthy ostriches before considering the 400 healthy carcasses weighing ~140,000 pounds, proposed for disposal at the RDCK Ootischenia Landfill near Castlegar, BC. \nCurrent Status: Judge Zinn upheld CFIA’s narrow arguments allowing a potential cull of 400 ostriches despite their perfect health status with no illness or deaths for four months. \nCompensation and Fines \nCompensation Uncertainty: CFIA lists up to $3,000 per poultry bird online as per a January 27, 2025, news release, but no ostrich-specific value is defined. No compensation communication has been received as of May 20, 2025, and $3,000 per bird is far below their true value. The ongoing market value of an ostrich rooster is $7500 CDN each. The value of an antibody-producing hen is $93,000 CDN each. Compensation can be voided by CFIA as per below. Worth noting, are you are aware, that us all, as taxpayers pay for all CFIA actions, wages and costs. This includes all culling processes, compensation to farmers, court, travel, etc. \nFines: Two unjustified $10,000 fines threaten to eliminate any compensation. Both fines were challenged and documents filed to CFIA. We are working to have these overturned. CFIA told a reporter that compensation is only when farms are compliant – taking them to court is far from compliant. \nCommitment to Transparency \nUniversal Ostrich Farms Inc. remains dedicated to ethical farming, rigorous science, and public safety. Our antibody research has shown immense potential, yet we face significant challenges from regulatory overreach and misinformation. We call for fair, science-based assessments and urge citizens to hold authorities accountable with the same scrutiny.

Let’s rise above the noise of accusations and focus on the real questions that deserve thoughtful answers. Farmers are juggling biosecurity measures, animal care, community concerns and so much more – this isn’t about avoiding hard conversations, it’s about supporting those who work tirelessly as farmers and for what is right.\n\n    If you read something you are not sure of or need clarification, please first refer to this living document at SaveOurOstriches.com. If questions still linger, feel free to email SaveOurOstriches@gmail.com before sharing possibly inaccurate information.\n\nAsking questions is much more productive than sharing unverified and misunderstood portions of information.  Please consider that sharing false information and statements can be considered defamation, will damage the farm’s reputation and increase our farm’s exposure to harm.\n\nWhen we choose collaboration over conflict we are stopping ‘shaking the ants’ actions, and instead forging a stronger, kinder and united future for our animals, farmers, and community.\n\n## **Official Statement from Universal Ostrich Farms Inc.**\n\nMay 21, 2025\n\n### **Background**  \n\nFor over 30 years, business partners Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski have upheld the highest standards in animal welfare and scientific integrity. Below, we clarify our history, practices, and recent challenges to address misinformation and affirm our dedication to transparency.  \n\n **Founding and Operations:** Incorporated in 2001, Universal Ostrich Farms Inc., led by Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski, has ethically raised ostriches for three decades with a focus on ethical breeding and care.   \n\n **Struthio Bioscience Inc:** Launched in May 2022, this division partnered with Dr. Tsukamoto of Kyoto University to develop and purify ostrich-derived antibodies (IgY) for research and therapeutic applications.   \n\n**Mission:** To advance sustainable farming and contribute to scientific progress through safe, non-invasive antibody production.  \n\n### **Antigen Research vs. Vaccination**  \n\n**Antigen Exposure:** In our projects we used only non-infectious antigens to stimulate antibody production in laying hens’ egg yolks while doing research. This is a standard process that is being used in natural avian antibody production. These fragments cannot cause disease. Antibodies are safely harvested from egg yolks without harming the birds.   \n\n**Terminology Clarified:**   \n\n*   **Inoculation** – The deliberate **introduction of a pure antigen** (by injection or any way of entry to the body), without any additional substances, to induce immunity and antibody production.  \n*   **Antigen exposure** – Is not a vaccine. It uses non-infectious fragments to prime immunity.  \n*   **Vaccination** – The process of administration of a **vaccine**.  \n*   **Vaccine** – A substance that contains disease causing preparation of killed, weakened, or part of a microorganism, as well as adjuvants, preservatives, and chemicals, to stimulate the immune system to protect against disease in the future.  \n*   **Immunization** – The broad term for any process (natural or artificial) that readies the immune system to fight a potential invader. It represents both vaccination and inoculation processes.   \n\n**Safety:** Our antigen exposure process is distinct from vaccination, using ostriches’ natural immune systems. We do NOT produce antibodies with live viruses or mRNA.  \n\n### **Farm Operations and Health History** \n\n**Current Focus:** Since 2020, we have focused on breeding, antibody research, and supporting new farmers that want to get into the agriculture industry. Meat processing ceased in the summer of 2019.  \n\n **2020 Pseudomonas Outbreak:** In March 2020, a diagnosis of Pseudomonas bacterial infection confirmed by a lab and veterinarian, affected ≈3% of birds (10 birds total) with survivors developing natural and eventual herd immunity. No further outbreaks or disease occurred until December 2024.   \n\n **Bird Sales:** In June 2021, six birds (neither injected with antigens nor offspring of injected hens) were sold for breeding, not food, as breeders are too valuable for slaughter. No injected birds entered the food chain.  \n\n### **COVID-19 Antibody Research (2020–2021)**  \n\n**Collaboration:** Periods in April to October in both 2020 and 2021, we contracted out Immune BioSolutions for them to provide an antigen, which has been historically given to chickens, and to extract and purify the Universal Ostrich Farm antibodies under regular common non-disclosure confidentiality clauses on COVID-19 antibody research. Separately, Immune BioSolutions received a $13.44 Million grant from the Canadian government for their own work. Universal Ostrich Farms and Struthio BioScience did not receive any payment, funding or benefit from Immune BioSolutions nor directly from the Government. Instead, the farm’s contract was abruptly terminated, without any reason presented to the farm.\n\n**Antigen Use:** Immune BioSolutions provided pre-tested antigens to stimulate antibodies in hens (not roosters). These were 98% effective at neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19 and its variants, with ostrich antibodies outperforming chicken antibodies by 30–40%.  \n\n**Project Termination:** The contract with the farm abruptly halted as mentioned above, with no reasons provided. Immune BioSolutions retained some of the farm’s most effective antibodies.  Again, no payments came to the farm from Immune BioSolutions. \n\n### **Japanese Research**  \n\n**Japanese Collaboration:**  Unrelated to Universal Ostrich Farm, Dr. Tsukamoto, a Japanese government-funded Kyoto University president, tested Covid-19 antibody-infused mask liners in Japan. This was Tsukamoto’s OWN research with his own ostriches, as he has his own farm. He offered H5N1 antibodies to the Canadian government in 2025, receiving no response. Universal Ostrich Farm **did not produce or sell masks** and have no ties to the World Economic Forum (WEF). What, if any, affiliations that Dr. Tsukamoto may have with WEF is unknown to us and our farm.  \n\n### **December 2024–January 2025 Health Events**  \n\n**Initial Case:** On December 10, 2024, a 3-year-old ostrich hen developed pneumonia-like symptoms, presenting the same symptoms as 2020 (see above). This hen was treated using the same protocols prescribed by the vet in 2020. The hen fully recovered and is alive and well today.   \n\n **Outbreak:** From December 14, 2024, to January 14, 2025, 69 young male and female breeders died, most of them under four years old. These young breeders were born or acquired after 2020, therefore they were lacking the 2020 Pseudomonas immunity. The 69 died over 31 days (~2/day). Each sick bird was immediately quarantined and many recovered with treatments.   \n\n **Distinction from HPAI:** Unlike High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which is said to kill entire avian flocks in 24 hours, this farm’s illness resulted in only approximately 15% of deaths which occurred over 31 days as it slowly ran its course until reaching full herd immunity on January 14th. According to CFIA lab documents, this illness involves a new hybrid of Low Pathogenic (LPAI) and High Pathogenic (HPAI) Avian Influenza, confirmed by PCR testing done by CFIA, in their internal and self-regulated labs.  The LPAI portion of this hybrid is important in indicating that this illness is much less deadly, as per CFIA. \n\n### **CFIA Testing and Cull Order**  \n\n**CFIA Involvement:** Following an anonymous tip on December 28th , 2024, CFIA called the farm and agreed, based on symptoms, this did not sound like avian influenza. CFIA told the farm to call when they had 2 new carcasses available for testing. On December 29th , the farm called CFIA as there were 2 more deaths.  \n\nCFIA tested the two carcasses on December 30, 2024, with preliminary H5 results from an internal self-regulated CFIA/Ministry of Agriculture lab in Abbotsford, BC. A cull order was signed and issued 41 minutes after the PCR test results were known, before N1 confirmation from the Winnipeg internal self-regulated CFIA lab results were known on January 10, 2025.\n\nNo details of the testing, handling, and shipment of the test samples have been disclosed, even upon multiple requests by the farm. This chain of custody is normally provided to ensure proper procedures are followed to avoid flawed results. Additionally, CFIA orders state that NO testing, including third party testing can be done. In fact, the farm is under order that they cannot treat or test their own animals, which the farm normally does themselves.  \n\n**Testing Restrictions:** Independent “gold-standard” tissue testing and any other testing of any kind is prohibited, with threats of $200,000 fines and/or six months in jail for conducting our own tests, as per Health of Animals Act Section 66.b.  Thus, only PCR testing was done by CFIA on two carcasses. It is commonly believed that PCR testing is limited and contradictory. PCR is not the gold standard testing method and is not recommended as a diagnostic tool. \n\n**Exemption and Rejection:** A “rare genetics” exemption was promised by a CFIA officer in writing on January 2, 2025 but was rejected 8 days later, on January 10, In a CFIA “Distinct Unit Package” exemption request form. The farm was told if any answers were NO that they would immediately get denied an exemption. BUT, the form was intended for commercial poultry thus nothing on the form was relevant for a non-commercial Ostrich farm. \n\n### **Legal Actions and Court Outcomes**  \n\n**Injunction:** On January 31, 2025 Universal Ostrich farm won an injunction to pause a February 1 cull order, compelling CFIA to justify its decision via Judicial Review based limited to only data known from December 31, 2024, to January 10, 2025.\n\n**Judicial Review:** On April 15–16, 2025, a Federal Court in Vancouver reviewed all evidence pertaining to the Notice to Dispose Order issued on December 31st, 2024 and the Exemption Denial dated January 10th, 2025. The Judgement and Reasons were posted on May 13, 2025, exactly 27 days after the hearing ended. Under administrative law, Justice Zinn’s hands were tied.\n\nAs Judge Zinn quoted in his decision in Paragraph 3:  \n“This is not an appeal. The Court is not stepping into the shoes of the Agency and making the decisions that the Court feels ought to have been made. Instead, the focus of the review is on the Agency’s reasoning and process.” \n\nContinuing to Paragraph 5:    \n“Courts must respect Parliament’s choice to assign decision-making power to administrative bodies. This respect comes from the principle of separation of powers a cornerstone of Canadian public law”  \n\n The Judge couldn’t consider anything after January 10th , including the fact that Universal Ostrich Farm has had no illness or deaths since January 14, 2025.  \n\n As the Judge revealed, it was not within his power to determine what was right or wrong. The court’s rule was limited to whether the CFIA exercised their policies and acted within reasonable fairness. It is the CFIA’s policies that need to be challenged and changed, and that cannot be done in a judicial review.  A separate action needs to be filed for this. \n\n**RDCK Statement:** On May 15, 2025, supported by intense public pressure, the Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) voted unanimously that CFIA test all healthy ostriches before considering the 400 healthy carcasses weighing ~140,000 pounds, proposed for disposal at the RDCK Ootischenia Landfill near Castlegar, BC.  \n\n**Current Status:** Judge Zinn upheld CFIA’s narrow arguments allowing a potential cull of 400 ostriches despite their perfect health status with no illness or deaths for four months.  \n\n### **Compensation and Fines**  \n\n**Compensation Uncertainty:** CFIA lists up to $3,000 per poultry bird online as per a January 27, 2025, news release, but no ostrich-specific value is defined. No compensation communication has been received as of May 20, 2025, and $3,000 per bird is far below their true value. The ongoing market value of an ostrich rooster is $7500 CDN each. The value of an antibody-producing hen is $93,000 CDN each. Compensation can be voided by CFIA as per below. Worth noting, are you are aware, that us all, as taxpayers pay for all CFIA actions, wages and costs.  This includes all culling processes, compensation to farmers, court, travel, etc. \n\n **Fines:** Two unjustified $10,000 fines threaten to eliminate any compensation. Both fines were challenged and documents filed to CFIA. We are working to have these overturned. CFIA told a reporter that compensation is only when farms are compliant – taking them to court is far from compliant. \n\n### **Commitment to Transparency** \n\nUniversal Ostrich Farms Inc. remains dedicated to ethical farming, rigorous science, and public safety. Our antibody research has shown immense potential, yet we face significant challenges from regulatory overreach and misinformation. We call for fair, science-based assessments and urge citizens to hold authorities accountable with the same scrutiny.

Premier David Eby said Wednesday at an unrelated news conference that the province had been frustrated by the actions of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and while they understand the need to contain the avian flu, there’s a lack of ability to evaluate on a case-by-case basis.\n“I hope the federal government looks very carefully at appropriate compensation to ensure they’re made whole, not that that can fill in for the massive loss that they’ve seen,” Eby said.\nThe Federal Court ruling said the family could be compensated up to $3,000 for each bird.\nAn animal law advocacy group has urged the federal government to pause the cull and consider “whether killing the birds still makes sense considering how much time has passed since the initial order was issued.”\n“Avian flu is a devastating disease that must be taken seriously, but these ostriches shouldn’t be forced to pay for the failures of a broken system,” says Kaitlyn Mitchell, director of legal advocacy with Animal Justice. “Avian flu outbreaks are exacerbated by rampant factory farming, yet it’s the individual birds who pay the ultimate price.”","markdown":"# Supporters converge on B.C. ostrich farm as federal food agency confirms cull of flock, National Post\n\n_A Federal Court ruling has rejected the farm’s bid to prevent the killings, which were ordered after an outbreak of avian flu_\n\n![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-2-1024x768.png)\n\n[**National Post**](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/bc-ostrich-farm-cull) | May 14, 2025\n\nOperators of a British Columbia ostrich farm where 400 birds have been ordered culled said Wednesday that dozens of supporters have converged on the scene, as the federal agency in charge of the operation confirmed it would begin the “humane depopulation” of the animals.\n\nHowever, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said it would not publicize operational plans or dates of the cull at Universal Ostrich Farms in Edgewood, B.C.\n\nWednesday’s statement came a day after a Federal Court ruling that rejected the farm’s bid to prevent the killings, which were ordered after an outbreak of avian flu.\n\n“The CFIA will begin the humane depopulation and disposal of birds at the infected premises with veterinary oversight,” the agency said.\n\nThe Regional District of Central Kootenay said it had already received provincial permission for its landfill in Castlegar, B.C., to handle the carcasses.\n\nKatie Pasitney, whose parents own the farm, said in an interview that the family will fight to save the ostriches through legal means, even as her mother called on supporters to surround the farm to prevent the cull.\n\nPasitney said Wednesday that about 40 supporters had arrived.\n\n“Banners, camping, their cars.

Premier David Eby said Wednesday at an unrelated news conference that the province had been frustrated by the actions of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and while they understand the need to contain the avian flu, there’s a lack of ability to evaluate on a case-by-case basis.\n\n“I hope the federal government looks very carefully at appropriate compensation to ensure they’re made whole, not that that can fill in for the massive loss that they’ve seen,” Eby said.\n\nThe Federal Court ruling said the family could be compensated up to $3,000 for each bird.\n\nAn animal law advocacy group has urged the federal government to pause the cull and consider “whether killing the birds still makes sense considering how much time has passed since the initial order was issued.”\n\n“Avian flu is a devastating disease that must be taken seriously, but these ostriches shouldn’t be forced to pay for the failures of a broken system,” says Kaitlyn Mitchell, director of legal advocacy with Animal Justice. “Avian flu outbreaks are exacerbated by rampant factory farming, yet it’s the individual birds who pay the ultimate price.”","debug":{"requestHandlerMode":"browser"}}

Kennedy, who was asked about it during an interview on a New York radio show last month and told the host he was “horrified by the idea that they are going to kill these animals.”\nKatie Pasitney, whose mother is co-owner of the farm, has called for a peaceful protest and said they are looking for legal measures that can be taken to try to stop the decision from being carried out.\nIn a video message posted on Facebook, Pasitney’s mother, Karen Espersen, urged supporters to “come surround the farm” and “don’t let them do this to these beautiful animals.”\nA herd of ostriches is seen on a remote farm in Edgewood, B.C., in an undated photo supplied by Universal Ostrich Farms Inc. (Katie Pasitney/Canadian Press)\n“We’ve taken years to be able to pet these guys, walk among these guys,” she said, walking through the herd. “We love these guys. They’re all happy and healthy. If we don’t stand for this … then what kind of world have we become?”\nThe family says the animals that survived the outbreak have recovered and are happy and healthy, having developed what Pasitney claims is “herd immunity” to the virus, which makes the birds more valuable to researchers alive than dead.\nB.C ostrich farm ‘devastated’ after federal judge rules cull of nearly 400 birds can proceed\n3 MLAs are supporting a B.C. farming family whose 400 ostriches are to be culled\nShe has argued that the birds who remain should be retested to see if they still have the disease and, if not, should be allowed to live and be studied.\n“Let’s take their blood. Let’s do an analysis. Let’s do a control study,” she said in an interview with CBC News.\n“As long as we have migratory birds, we will have avian influenza, so eradicating all of our livestock and hurting our farmers… is not the solution.”\nOn Wednesday, she said about 40 supporters had already arrived, with the possibility of more to come.\nAnimal rights group weighs in\nThe farm is also supporting a letter-writing campaign targeted at the Regional District of Central Kootenay, urging it not to accept dead ostriches at local landfills.\nRegional District of Central Kootenay spokesman Dan Elliott says it received the landfill certificate to possibly handle the dead ostriches in January, adding the district has not received any information on when a possible cull would happen.\nA poster advertises a convoy to Universal Ostrich to protest the ordered cull in February 2025. (Facebook/B.C. Rising)\n“In response to the need to manage avian influenza disease, the Regional District of Central Kootenay has received an operational certificate from the provincial Ministry of Environment and Parks to handle the disposal of the avian influenza-infected waste if the culling of the ostriches goes ahead,” Elliott says.\nMeanwhile, an animal law group has urged the federal government to pause the cull and consider “whether killing the birds still makes sense considering how much time has passed since the initial order was issued.”\n“Avian flu is a devastating disease that must be taken seriously, but these ostriches shouldn’t be forced to pay for the failures of a broken system,” says Animal Justice director of legal advocacy Kaitlyn Mitchell. “Avian flu outbreaks are exacerbated by rampant factory farming, yet it’s the individual birds who pay the ultimate price.”\nAgency says cull needed to protect Canadian poultry industry\nThe CFIA, though, says its policy of killing all animals in domestic flocks where avian flu has been detected is necessary in order to contain the disease, which has the potential to mutate and spread to other animals and even humans, as when a teenager in B.C. was hospitalized for several weeks after being infected.\nB.C. ostrich farm gets stay of execution for birds ordered killed due to avian flu fears\nThis ostrich farm survived wildfires. Now, avian flu means 400 birds need to be culled\n“Allowing a domestic poultry flock known to be exposed to HPAI to remain alive allows a potential source of the virus to persist. It would increase the possibility of reassortment or mutation, particularly with birds raised in open pasture where there is ongoing exposure to wildlife. This could also increase the human health risk,” the statement says.\n“Our disease response aims to protect both public and animal health, as well as minimize impacts on the $6.8 billion domestic poultry industry, and the Canadian economy.”\nIn the court ruling, it was noted that Universal Ostrich is entitled to up to $3,000 per animal killed.\nJudge not convinced by farm’s arguments\nThe ruling also notes that it is not up to the courts to weigh in on the scientific evidence for and against the cull, with Justice Russell Zinn writing, “courts generally stay out of scientific debates,” and instead it is the place of “technical bodies,” such as the CFIA to “make judgments on complex, expertise-driven matters.”\nIn the ruling, which is by his own admission, “lengthy” at more than 100 pages, Zinn goes into detail about the decision-making around the cull and the arguments against it made by Universal Ostrich.\nThe ruling also lays out the steps that had been taken in ordering the cull, starting with an inspection of Universal Ostrich after the CFIA received an anonymous tip that dead ostriches had been seen at the farm in December 2024. It was later confirmed that between 25 and 30 ostriches had died in December, a number that would rise to 69 by mid-January. \nCFIA inspectors visited the farm in late December and collected samples from two dead birds that were later confirmed to have avian flu.

Because it’s not, I don’t want to be the person to say it’s not our problem, but it’s outside of our power. I know that might not be the answer you want to hear. Personally, I wish there was something I could do, but we are stuck with what we have, and we have to work within the bounds of our, we are a legislative body, so we have to respect the law. We are a country of laws, it went through all the courts.\nKatie Pasitney: I do have a question (Katie, owner of the farm). We just made it here just in time. I woke up and I had meetings all morning. We just said, we’re going, because I knew I needed to stand in front of all of you, from our farm, today. I do have a question, Chair. Will you publicly retract the false claim that UOF (Universal Ostrich Farms) lost two court cases and correct the record at this board? Because the record matters, and moving forward with disposal based on misinformation, without a legal mandate, is not just reckless—it makes this board liable for voluntary participation.\nI urge you all to take a step back, verify the facts, and act in truth.\nSorry, it’s been a journey. I’m here today to correct a serious falsehood that was entered into the public record of this board. It was stated that Universal Ostrich Farm has lost two court cases. That is not true. Let me absolutely be clear: Universal Ostrich Farm has not lost any legal case. What we did do was file for and win a judicial review granted by Justice Batista. That review was heard on April 15th and 16th in Vancouver, and the decision was released this week by Federal Court by Justice Zinn.\nBut here’s the part that matters to you: In paragraphs 7 and 8 of that ruling, Justice Zinn states that the court can only rule on decisions made by the CFIA before January 10th, 2025. The court was legally barred from considering any evidence after that date. That means the current health of our animals, the current health of our 400 healthy animals, any new test results, any recovery or scientific data—none of it could be considered. This ruling does not validate CFIA’s current actions; only that what they did at that time was, in the court’s view, reasonable based on what they knew then.\nWith respect, I ask you to please consider the now. Because we are in a fight for these animals that hold way more value alive than they do dead, by accepting their dead carcasses into this landfill. You can set a precedent because we have a recovered flock. We can set a precedent with all of your power in all of your seats, and everything that we stand for here today and all the voices from across our country, and the global attention that this issue is getting, we can set a precedent.\nOur animals are healthy, they’re laying eggs, they’re beautiful, and we are being restricted the chance from retesting our animals to prove to you as the public, that they are recovered. We are being threatened six months in jail and a $250,000 fine to bring you that evidence.\nSo where do we stop this? We stop it at Universal Ostrich Farm.\nChair, Aidan McLaren-Caux: I believe I we have a director who has a motion. Directors, please check your email, so you have a copy of it, it should have been sent out a few minutes ago. Director Lunn, would you like to make your motion?\nDirector Jessica Lunn: Sure, I would like to move that the RDCK board direct staff to withhold acceptance at any landfill ostrich carcasses originating from a farm in Edgewood, BC, planned to be culled and delivered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as a result of being exposed to highly pathogenic avian influenza, until the number of birds confirmed infected with HPAI and the number classified as exposed—based on testing performed after May 15, 2025—is confirmed by the CFIA and/or the Ministry of Agriculture and Food. Further, the RDCK requests that the CFIA provide this information directly to the public in a timely and transparent manner to support public understanding and trust.\nDirector Diana Lockwood: I’ll second that.\nDirector Andy Davidoff: I’ll second that.\nChair, Aidan McLaren-Caux: The motion has been duly moved and seconded. Do we have any discussion? Anything online? Alright, all those in favour? Oh, everybody. Motion carried. Thank you.\nKatie Pasitney: Thank you.

Thanks for being there. \nCourtroom Notes provided by Kari Simpson\nUpdate #1\nCourt convened at 9:32. Justice Zinn began the hearing by raising troubling conduct experienced by staff from certain people attending the hearing.\nJustice Zinn informed those attending that court staff were subject to “rude and racist comments.” Justice Zinn rightly chastised those responsible and informed those attending that the court maintains a polite and harassment free service.\n(Writer’s comments- Judges as you can see, are vigilant and informed about what is transpiring in and out of the courtroom. Please conduct yourself in a manner that is helpful and allows the focus to remain on the important matter before the court.)\nJustice Zinn then delved right into the case and raised concerns about the applicants failure to raise the issue of the Avian Flu pathogen being high or low transmission. He stated that the Respondent CFIA “quite rightly raised this issue as it was not an issue raised in the memorandum.”\nThe Ostrich farm lawyers assured Justice Zinn that they would address this in reply.\nCFIA lawyer Jones then began her attack on the expert reports submitted in support of the ostrich farm.\nUpdate #2\nIt is the role of opposing counsel to try to destroy the Applicant’s case. Tax payer funded, Dept of Justice lawyer Ms. Jones acting for CFIA has a tricky way of making untrue statements that seemingly undermine the Ostrich farm but then she adds a twist of truth. so shecreally isnt misleading the court but raising doubt. Here’s an example.\nLawyer Jones began her assault on the Ostrich farm experts right out of the gate. First target is highly respected scientists Dr. Stephen Pelech. First citing the test for what constitutes an expert report, relevance, necessity, absence of exclusionary rule…\nTurning to Dr Pelech’s credentials Jones tries to pain a picture that Dr Pelech has no experience with animals, Then she says his only experience is with animals in a laboratory, then she states he has “no experience in animal health.” She uses these tactics to undermine 4 out of the 5 Ostrich farm experts.\nUpdate #3\nCFIA lawyer Saunders has taken over from his co counsel.\nSaunders is trying to educate the judge on matters involving stamping out vs exempting specific epidemiological units. Weaving in the WHOA policies and procedures.\nClearly this line of submissions is to counter the fiasco involving the designating the farm as exempted due to the valuable and rare genetics and then 8 days later revoking that distinction.\nUpdate #4\nMorning break and then through to the lunch interesting discussion on CFIAs position on vaccination.\nLawyer Saunders advances CFIAs preference to combating Avian flu is through the stamping out policy, stating that CFIA vaccination policy is continually under review.\nAt 11:16 Saunders makes this bizarre declaration referring to cases where CFIA would vaccinate. He says, “I want to stress that is that it is for prevention of being infected. That’s what it’s being used for in the policy you don’t vaccinate after the infection for the same reason you wouldn’t get the flu shot after you’ve already got the flu shot for that year.”\n(Writers comment- totally different claim the government made during COVID!)\nNext discussion was on how WHOA protects trade, lots of time spent on this.\nJudge interjects with a question about how zones are defined.\nSaunders didn’t seem to understand his question and goes into a long winded response that didn’t answer the question.\nNext issues involves exemptions and selective killing vs stamping out. Saunders claims Canadian Poultry associations support stamping out over selective killing because of trade implications but does cite any authority or letter.\nNext Saunders refers to legal authorities that address issues of what is fair and reasonable.\nLunch break. \nUpdate 5\n1:35 pm – CFIA lawyer Jones is going thru the process CFIA followed to determine the need to kill all the ostriches.\nAt 1:42 ish lawyer Michael Carter informs the court that there is a problem with the zoom feed.\nJudge addresses the problem with clerks, discussions take place as to continue or not. Justice Zinn, adds a much needed moment of levity to this very serious case and asks, “Maybe Trump imposed a tariff on zoom.”\nJustice Zinn’s clever and perfectly delivered zinger was well received by those quietly trying not to laugh too loudly.\nIt is soon determined that the zoom is working for most and those who can’t connect should retry link.\nBack to the submission by Ms Jones.\nShe starts at the time there was an anonymous call to the sick bird call line. Her account isn’t correct.\nShe spends a lot of time trying to prove that the CFIA acted in a fair and reasonable manner.\nUpdate 6\nCFIA lawyer is spending a lot of time trying to present a narrative that the farm owners were fully informed in understanding what information was required to be designated as having rare and valuable genetics.\nSparks flying in the court! Shortly after lawyer for CFIA concluded her submissions judge raised issues that have ignited some spirited submissions, happening now!\nUpdate 7\nCourt time has been extended. CFIA lawyers took extra time leaving the Ostrich farm lawyers with less time for reply.\nLawyer Lee Turner has informed the court that he is not available to stay for an extended time.\nTension is high. Lawyer for CFIA keeps interrupting, lecture judge again that his job is not based of findings of fact but only whether CFIA acted in a reasonable and fair manner.\nUpdate 8\nOstrich farm lawyer Lee Turner corrected the misinformation given to the court by CFIA lawyers.\nNow Ostrich farm lawyer Michael Carter focusing on the deficiencies in the decision making by CFIA. The evidence proves they made decisions on incomplete information. Didn’t take into consideration the fact the older birds didn’t get sick.\nNow reviewing with the court other case precedents that apply to what is irrational decision making.

They’re very curious.

A federal agency ordered the farmers to kill off their herd after avian flu was detected at the site in December, but the owners are pushing back. Brady Strachan reports.\nIt’s the latest development in a saga of the farm in the B.C. Interior whose owners have turned to the courts and the court of public opinion to save what it says are roughly 400 birds in their care. \nUniversal Ostrich is located on a rural road near Edgewood, in B.C.’s West Kootenay region. Getting there is an approximately 175 kilometre drive from Kelowna along a winding highway, or about 360 kilometres northeast of Vancouver as the crow flies.\nAnd for the past several weeks, it has been the site of a growing set of supporters who view the order to kill the birds, who can live for 30 or even 40 years, as an example of government overreach that fails to account for the specifics of the situation being faced by the farm’s owners, Espersen and Dave Bilinski, who have raised some of the birds facing death for decades.\n“We just want transparency,” said Pasitney, who has been acting as a spokesperson for her mother’s farm.\nKatie Pasitney hugs supporters after learning the ostriches on her mother’s farm will not have to be killed until after a court hearing ruling on an order from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to cull the entire herd. (Brady Strachan/CBC)\nPasitney said that while some ostriches on the farm have indeed died of avian flu — 69 in total — they are just a small percentage of the overall flock. And, she said, all of those who have died were younger, while the remaining older ostriches are in good health.\n“We’re at herd immunity,” she argued, saying there have been no new deaths since Jan. 14, and telling CBC News that of the birds who are still alive, none are exhibiting symptoms of the illness. (Researchers contacted by CBC News say there is limited information on whether ostriches can develop immunity to avian flu.)\nThis ostrich farm survived wildfires. Now, avian flu means 400 birds need to be culled\nThe risks of spread are also minimized, Espersen said, because Universal Ostrich does not sell its birds for meat.\nInstead, the farm has in recent years pivoted to raising the ostriches to research their ability to fight diseases, saying they have a partnership with Japan’s Kyoto Prefectural University, which has previously made headlines for its work with ostrich eggs and detecting COVID-19.\nCBC News has reached out to the university, but has not heard back. \nSupporters and media have been told to keep their distance from ostriches at Universal Ostrich as the farm follows quarantine rules. (Brady Strachan/CBC)\nSo far, the assurances from Universal Ostrich have not been able to reverse a decision from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), which told CBC News it was reviewing its options following Friday’s court ruling.\nThe agency issued a cull order on Dec. 31 after detecting avian flu at the farm earlier that month, and gave the owners a deadline of Feb. 1 — this Saturday — to have the ostriches eliminated.\nWidespread disease\nThough that initial deadline is no longer in place, the herd may still have to be killed, depending on the outcome of the upcoming court case. If that happens, the herd will join the close to nine million domestic birds in B.C. and more than 14 million Canada-wide that have either been culled or died on their own after being infected with the current H5N1 strain of avian flu — which the CFIA is referring to as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), first detected in the province in 2022.\nThe death count includes poultry on more than 200 current and previously infected premises in B.C., mostly farms and processing facilities, but also extends to at least one petting zoo, whose owner described the heartbreaking process of saying goodbye to more than four dozen chickens and ducks who “each had names and were more than just ‘livestock,'” according to a post from the zoo’s owner.\nThat’s much the same as how Universal Ostrich describes its animals — who Pasitney has been introducing on social media to drum up support.\nWATCH | Pasitney tours her mother’s farm, naming individual ostriches: \nCBC Player \nOstrich farm faces Feb. 1 cull\nKatie Pasitney of Universal Ostrich introduces some of her Facebook followers to the ostriches who have been ordered killed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency after avian flu was detected at the farm.\nIn a statement posted this week, the CFIA acknowledged the emotional toll the death of animals can take but said its job is to minimize the risk of the virus spreading, including potentially to humans.\n“Our disease response has aimed to protect public and animal health, minimize impacts on the domestic poultry industry, and the Canadian economy.… In domestic poultry, including ostriches, this is accomplished through the timely depopulation of domestic birds on infected premises.”\nThe duty to do this, the agency said, is outlined in its mandate under the Health of Animals Act and the World Organisation for Animal Health, of which Canada is a member.\nOstriches at Universal Ostrich in Edgewood, B.C. on Jan. 31, 2025. (Brady Strachan/CBC)\nRisks vs. benefits in culling decisions\nAvian flu can spread rapidly between domestic and wild birds, whose long migration patterns give even more opportunity for the disease to be passed on between communities and into other animal populations, including humans.\nSpeaking in a video court session Friday, the legal counsel for the CFIA emphasized the agency’s position and job in minimizing that risk.\n“Whether or not the birds recover and appear healthy is not the concern when implementing a cull policy,” said lawyer Paul Saunders. \n“That concern also includes the potential for the mutation of the virus among healthy birds…. an infection in birds could be a precursor to a human flu pandemic. Regardless of how likely that is, once it happens, it’s happened, so that is a concern motivating the CFIA’s response.”\nUniversal Ostrich’s case was argued by lawyer Michael Carter, who said that both the courts and the CFIA should take into account the “unique circumstances” of the ostrich farm, including its remote location and the difference between the large, flightless birds and the poultry farms where most of the culls so far have taken place.\nHe said the CFIA had other options at its disposal which should be considered, including ongoing quarantine and monitoring of the birds, and he criticized the agency’s “automatic stamping out” policy.\nBoth sides agreed that one of the key questions before the court was that of the relative risks the public should have to bear when it comes to allowing the birds to live — a question not easily answered, according to veterinary experts.\nIn an email to CBC News, J. Scott Weese, a professor at the Ontario Veterinary College, said the practice makes sense in general “when there’s widespread infection, risk to people around the animals, limited other exposure risk,” and in cases where there’s limited value — be it economic, personal or for conservation purposes — of the animals being killed.\nThe entrance to Universal Ostrich in Edgewood, B.C. on Jan. 31, 2025. (Brady Strachan/CBC)\nHe urged caution around claims that the remaining ostriches on the farm might be immune to avian flu, noting that research in the field is weak, but said there is less of an argument in favour of a cull from a disease-control standpoint now that the H5N1 strain of avian flu has been well-established. \n“An individual group of birds is a drop in the bucket now,” he said. “Culling probably has little population benefit.” \nHe added, though, that from a “risk aversion standpoint,” a cull is the “easiest thing” to do.\nAnd the risks of allowing avian flu to spread are especially pronounced in B.C. where, last year, a 13-year-old girl was the first in Canada to be domestically infected with H5N1. She spent several weeks in intensive care at B.C.

A federal agency ordered the farmers to kill off their herd after avian flu was detected at the site in December, but the owners are pushing back. Brady Strachan reports.\n\nIt’s the latest development in a saga of the farm in the B.C. Interior whose owners have turned to the courts and the court of public opinion to save what it says are roughly 400 birds in their care. \n\nUniversal Ostrich is located on a rural road near Edgewood, in B.C.’s West Kootenay region. Getting there is an approximately 175 kilometre drive from Kelowna along a winding highway, or about 360 kilometres northeast of Vancouver as the crow flies.\n\nAnd for the past several weeks, it has been the site of a growing set of supporters who view the order to kill the birds, who can live for 30 or even 40 years, as an example of government overreach that fails to account for the specifics of the situation being faced by the farm’s owners, Espersen and Dave Bilinski, who have raised some of the birds facing death for decades.\n\n“We just want transparency,” said Pasitney, who has been acting as a spokesperson for her mother’s farm.\n\n![People hug.](https://i.cbc.ca/1.7447832.1738363615!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/katie-pasitney.jpg?im=)\n\nKatie Pasitney hugs supporters after learning the ostriches on her mother’s farm will not have to be killed until after a court hearing ruling on an order from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to cull the entire herd. (Brady Strachan/CBC)\n\nPasitney said that while some ostriches on the farm have indeed died of avian flu — 69 in total — they are just a small percentage of the overall flock. And, she said, all of those who have died were younger, while the remaining older ostriches are in good health.\n\n“We’re at herd immunity,” she argued, saying there have been no new deaths since Jan. 14, and telling CBC News that of the birds who are still alive, none are exhibiting symptoms of the illness. (Researchers contacted by CBC News say there is limited information on whether ostriches can develop immunity to avian flu.)\n\n*   [This ostrich farm survived wildfires. Now, avian flu means 400 birds need to be culled](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-ostrich-farm-edgewood-1.7429394)\n\nThe risks of spread are also minimized, Espersen said, because Universal Ostrich does not sell its birds for meat.\n\nInstead, the farm has in recent years pivoted to raising the ostriches to research their ability to fight diseases, saying they have a partnership with Japan’s Kyoto Prefectural University, which has [previously made headlines for its work with ostrich eggs and detecting COVID-19](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/scientists-ostrich-cells-glowing-covid-detection-masks).\n\nCBC News has reached out to the university, but has not heard back. \n\n![A sign that says Environmental Farm Plan, Universal Ostrich Inc.

If that happens, the herd will join the close to nine million domestic birds in B.C. and more than 14 million Canada-wide that have either been culled or died on their own after being infected with the current H5N1 strain of avian flu — which the CFIA is referring to as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), first detected in the province in 2022.\n\nThe death count includes poultry on more than 200 current and previously infected premises in B.C., mostly farms and processing facilities, but also extends to at least one [petting zoo](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/avian-flu-vancouver-island-petting-farm-1.7374291), whose owner described the heartbreaking process of saying goodbye to more than four dozen chickens and ducks who “each had names and were more than just ‘livestock,'” according to a post from the zoo’s owner.\n\nThat’s much the same as how Universal Ostrich describes its animals — who Pasitney has been introducing on social media to drum up support.\n\n**_WATCH | Pasitney tours her mother’s farm, naming individual ostriches:_** \n\n    CBC Player\n\n![](https://i.cbc.ca/ais/5e537679-b568-469d-839d-2b0cfa5d4a50,1738289721040/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1920%2C1080%29%3BResize%3D1180)\n\nOstrich farm faces Feb. 1 cull\n\nKatie Pasitney of Universal Ostrich introduces some of her Facebook followers to the ostriches who have been ordered killed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency after avian flu was detected at the farm.\n\nIn a [statement posted this week](https://inspection.canada.ca/en/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/latest-bird-flu-situation/investigations-and-orders/hpai-ostrich-farm), the CFIA acknowledged the emotional toll the death of animals can take but said its job is to minimize the risk of the virus spreading, including potentially to humans.\n\n“Our disease response has aimed to protect public and animal health, minimize impacts on the domestic poultry industry, and the Canadian economy.… In domestic poultry, including ostriches, this is accomplished through the timely depopulation of domestic birds on infected premises.”\n\nThe duty to do this, the agency said, is outlined in its mandate under the Health of Animals Act and the [World Organisation for Animal Health](https://inspection.canada.ca/en/animal-health/chief-veterinary-officer/woah), of which Canada is a member.\n\n![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1-1024x576.png)\n\nOstriches at Universal Ostrich in Edgewood, B.C. on Jan. 31, 2025. (Brady Strachan/CBC)\n\n**Risks vs. benefits in culling decisions**\n\nAvian flu can spread rapidly between domestic and wild birds, whose long migration patterns give even more opportunity for the disease to be passed on between communities and into other animal populations, including humans.\n\nSpeaking in a video court session Friday, the legal counsel for the CFIA emphasized the agency’s position and job in minimizing that risk.\n\n“Whether or not the birds recover and appear healthy is not the concern when implementing a cull policy,” said lawyer Paul Saunders. \n\n“That concern also includes the potential for the mutation of the virus among healthy birds…. an infection in birds could be a precursor to a human flu pandemic. Regardless of how likely that is, once it happens, it’s happened, so that is a concern motivating the CFIA’s response.”\n\nUniversal Ostrich’s case was argued by lawyer Michael Carter, who said that both the courts and the CFIA should take into account the “unique circumstances” of the ostrich farm, including its remote location and the difference between the large, flightless birds and the poultry farms where most of the culls so far have taken place.\n\nHe said the CFIA had other options at its disposal which should be considered, including ongoing quarantine and monitoring of the birds, and he criticized the agency’s “automatic stamping out” policy.\n\nBoth sides agreed that one of the key questions before the court was that of the relative risks the public should have to bear when it comes to allowing the birds to live — a question not easily answered, according to veterinary experts.\n\nIn an email to CBC News, J. Scott Weese, a professor at the Ontario Veterinary College, said the practice makes sense in general “when there’s widespread infection, risk to people around the animals, limited other exposure risk,” and in cases where there’s limited value — be it economic, personal or for conservation purposes — of the animals being killed.\n\n![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-2-1024x576.png)\n\nThe entrance to Universal Ostrich in Edgewood, B.C. on Jan. 31, 2025. (Brady Strachan/CBC)\n\nHe urged caution around claims that the remaining ostriches on the farm might be immune to avian flu, noting that research in the field is weak, but said there is less of an argument in favour of a cull from a disease-control standpoint now that the H5N1 strain of avian flu has been well-established. \n\n“An individual group of birds is a drop in the bucket now,” he said. “Culling probably has little population benefit.” \n\nHe added, though, that from a “risk aversion standpoint,” a cull is the “easiest thing” to do.\n\nAnd the risks of allowing avian flu to spread are especially pronounced in B.C. where, last year, a 13-year-old girl was the first in Canada to be domestically infected with H5N1. She spent several weeks in intensive care at B.C. Children’s Hospital after experiencing respiratory failure and pneumonia.\n\nElsewhere, including in the United States, human death following infection has been reported and there are fears that if avian flu is allowed to spread and mutate, it could happen in Canada, too.\n\n“The CFIA takes the responsibility to protect the health of animals and Canadians extremely seriously as we conduct these necessary disease control measures to protect public health,” the CFIA said in its statement.\n\n![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-3-1024x576.png)\n\nPasitney says her ostriches pose little risk to the wider population, as they are flightless birds who are not being used for meat. (Submitted by Katie Pasitney)\n\nThe agency also said it has veterinarians and inspectors who work with farmers to come up with a humane plan for the killing of their birds, and that if the farms do not comply they can face fines and jail time.\n\nIt added that owners can be compensated — up to $3,000 per bird in the case of ostriches — with supporting documentation.\n\n“While compensation may not offset the emotional toll of depopulation, it can provide resources to recover and reestablish operations,” CFIA said.\n\nBut that’s not feasible for Universal Ostrich, Pasitney said.

For over three decades, Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski have devoted their lives to raising up to 500 ostriches on their farm, which is known for its groundbreaking research on the robust immune systems of these remarkable creatures.\nThe farm is home to a herd of non-commercial ostriches, some of which have been with the farmers for over 34 years. Karen’s daughter, Katie Pasitney, grew up with these ostriches and considers them more like family. Each has its own name and personality, like Frank, Lulu, and Q-Tip. \nHowever, an illness in December 2024 led to drastic government interventions, threatening both the lives of the ostriches and the livelihoods of the farmers who care for them.\nWhat Happened?\nThe situation began on December 10, 2024, when a three-year-old ostrich showed pneumonia-like symptoms. Although it recovered, some younger ostriches and those introduced to the farm after 2020 also became ill, resulting in 69 deaths out of 468 ostriches, or 15% of the original herd, over 36 days.\nThe farmers observed that ostriches previously exposed to a bacterial infection in 2020 showed no new symptoms or deaths, suggesting they had achieved herd immunity. Despite the losses, the remaining ostriches fully recovered, and as of January 15, 2025, no further illnesses or deaths have occurred.\nThough the ostriches are not being raised for food, it didn’t take long for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to get involved. \nOn December 28, the farm received a phone call from the CFIA, stating that they had received an anonymous tip that there was suspicion of avian flu on the farm and that they would be coming to take samples.\nOn December 30, CFIA agents arrived at the farm and conducted two PCR tests (oral and rectal) on two dead ostriches that had been deceased for over 24 hours. The farmers asked the attending CFIA agents if they would also test a couple of their healthy ostriches, and they were denied this request.\nThe next day, on December 31, the PCR results came back positive for H5N1 avian influenza, and a cull order was issued for the family to destroy all of their ostriches by February 1, 2025. The farmers were also given a set of quarantine requirements with instructions on how to dispose and bury their animals, along with a link to mental health support.\nDownload: CFIA Cull Order 2024-12-30 \nRequest for Additional Testing\nEspersen and Bilinski were shocked and requested further testing to confirm the results. They asked for tissue samples to be taken, as this is considered the gold standard for diagnosing any illness. They wanted to determine whether it was avian flu or something else, possibly a bacterial infection, as the symptoms resembled those that affected the farm in 2020. At that time, an autopsy and tissue sampling were conducted, and the vet identified it as pseudomonas, a bacteria commonly found in soil and water.\nThe farmers asked for the same testing protocol to be applied in order to confirm the results, but CFIA denied their request. Espersen and Bilinski were also informed that they were prohibited from testing or treating their animals, including independent evaluations from their vet, under the threat of a $200,000 fine and six months in jail.\nA Glimmer of Hope\nOn January 2, the farmers received an email from a CFIA agent stating their animals qualified for a depopulation exemption due to their rare and valuable genetics. The email included a Distinct Unit Request Package with a depopulation exemption form, which they were asked to complete to prevent the ostriches from being culled. \nDownload: 25-01-02-CFIA-email \nHowever, the form was intended for commercial poultry farms and did not apply to their situation. Espersen explained that the form couldn’t be filled out properly, as nearly every question was unrelated to ostriches. The CFIA agent warned that answering “no” or leaving questions unanswered would lead to the exemption being denied.\nThe following day, a five-hour meeting took place between top CFIA officials and the farmers. The CFIA expressed interest in learning more about the farm and its operations, requesting detailed information on their business plans and supporting research. Espersen and Bilinski freely shared this information, hoping it would demonstrate a unique and valuable opportunity for collaboration in studying and potentially funding important natural antibody research in Canada.\nThe Promise of Natural Antibodies\nThe ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms are valued not only for their genetic traits but also for their strong, robust immune systems, which have attracted the interest of researchers worldwide. After the farm stopped producing ostrich meat in 2020, Espersen and Bilinski shifted their focus to studying natural antibodies, collaborating with Dr. Yasuhiro Tsukamoto of Kyoto University, Japan, and Dr. Stu Greenberg from Boston. This joint research examines the unique properties of antibodies found in ostrich eggs and their potential applications across various fields of study.\nThe farmers believes their farm has the potential to provide critical insights into managing and controlling diseases in wild populations, such as migratory ducks and other wildlife species. “Why isn’t the CFIA working with us to come up with a solution?” Pasitney wonders. “Why are they so determined to destroy our healthy ostriches and stamp out their natural immunity?”\nExemption Request Denied\nOn January 10, the farmers received official correspondence from CFIA denying their request for a depopulation exemption, stating they did not meet the criteria for unique and rare genetics. They were also reminded that the cull order remained in effect, requiring them to destroy and dispose of all ostriches by February 1. In their email, the CFIA stated, “This decision is final and not subject to appeal.”\nDownload: 25-01-02-CFIA-letter-exemption-depopulation \nThis was a huge blow to the family, who felt this was their last chance to stop the unnecessary killing of their beloved ostriches.\nA Growing Movement to Save the Ostriches\nPasitney remembers the early days of feeling desperate for help. She reached out to friends, family, her community, and local news agencies and did as many interviews as possible with independent journalists, various media outlets, and podcasters. The story of the ostriches quickly spread, with people from all across Canada, the U.S., and now the world showing support.\nOn January 21, the day before the CFIA was scheduled for inspection, Pasitney and a group of community leaders held an emergency meeting. Within hours, the campaign “Save Our Ostriches” was launched. A website was set up, posters were designed, and social media posts were shared. People quickly mobilized, gathering at the farm the following morning to show their support.\nUpon hearing about the gathering, the CFIA cancelled its inspection an hour before it was scheduled, stating it was aware of protestors and would bring the RCMP next time. The 10 peaceful supporters holding handmade “Save Our Ostriches” signs on the side of the road weren’t surprised. It was yet another example of the government’s heavy-handed approach.\nThe next day, the CFIA sent another email at the end of the day that they would be returning the following morning. This gave the supporters little time to organize, but they still managed to gather 15 concerned citizens to quietly witness, film, and photograph the visit. As expected, the RCMP arrived, along with four CFIA agents dressed in full hazmat suits, to conduct a protocol check and ensure compliance with quarantine measures. This time, the farmers were ready, capturing footage, asking questions, and recording their interactions on social media.\nWatch CFIA Inspection Videos here. \nLegal Support\nDuring this time, the farmers garnered legal support from advocates and lawyers. A legal team quickly came together and worked around the clock to secure an emergency injunction on January 31, just one day before the scheduled cull order. \nFederal Judge Justice Michael Battista ruled to stay the cull order imposed by the CFIA, granting the farmers time to seek a judicial review of the case. \nThis brought happy tears to the family, who were watching the proceedings virtually from their Edgewood farm.

The CFIA also filed an appeal against Justice Battista’s ruling, claiming the judge “erred in law and in principle, and/or seriously misapprehended the facts.”\nWhat’s at Stake \nThe facts are that if the ostriches are culled, it would not only be a tragic loss of life but also a loss of valuable genetic material and groundbreaking research. These ostriches may revolutionize disease research and contribute to humanity in ways that have yet to be fully realized. \n“These ostriches have the ability to do something truly remarkable,” Pasitney says, choking up as she recalls her mother’s words from childhood.\n“My mom always said these ostriches would do something amazing for humanity one day. Maybe that time is now.”","markdown":"# About the \"Save our Ostriches\" Campaign and the Farm\n\nWhat would you do if, after thirty years of raising and caring for animals on your farm, the government suddenly showed up and ordered you to slaughter them?\n\nThis is the heartbreaking reality for the farmers of Universal Ostrich Farms, located in the remote town of Edgewood, British Columbia. For over three decades, Karen Espersen and Dave Bilinski have devoted their lives to raising up to 500 ostriches on their farm, which is known for its groundbreaking research on the robust immune systems of these remarkable creatures.\n\nThe farm is home to a herd of non-commercial ostriches, some of which have been with the farmers for over 34 years. Karen’s daughter, Katie Pasitney, grew up with these ostriches and considers them more like family. Each has its own name and personality, like Frank, Lulu, and Q-Tip. \n\n![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FrankLuluQ-Tip.png)\n\nHowever, an illness in December 2024 led to drastic government interventions, threatening both the lives of the ostriches and the livelihoods of the farmers who care for them.\n\n### **What Happened?**\n\nThe situation began on December 10, 2024, when a three-year-old ostrich showed pneumonia-like symptoms. Although it recovered, some younger ostriches and those introduced to the farm after 2020 also became ill, resulting in 69 deaths out of 468 ostriches, or 15% of the original herd, over 36 days.\n\nThe farmers observed that ostriches previously exposed to a bacterial infection in 2020 showed no new symptoms or deaths, suggesting they had achieved herd immunity. Despite the losses, the remaining ostriches fully recovered, and as of January 15, 2025, no further illnesses or deaths have occurred.\n\nThough the ostriches are not being raised for food, it didn’t take long for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to get involved. \n\nOn December 28, the farm received a phone call from the CFIA, stating that they had received an anonymous tip that there was suspicion of avian flu on the farm and that they would be coming to take samples.\n\nOn December 30, CFIA agents arrived at the farm and conducted two PCR tests (oral and rectal) on two dead ostriches that had been deceased for over 24 hours. The farmers asked the attending CFIA agents if they would also test a couple of their healthy ostriches, and they were denied this request.\n\nThe next day, on December 31, the PCR results came back positive for H5N1 avian influenza, and a **[cull order](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CFIA-cull-order-2024-12-30.pdf)** was issued for the family to destroy all of their ostriches by February 1, 2025. The farmers were also given a set of quarantine requirements with instructions on how to dispose and bury their animals, along with a link to mental health support.\n\n![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CFIA-cull-order-screenshot.png)\n\nDownload: **[CFIA Cull Order 2024-12-30](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CFIA-cull-order-2024-12-30.pdf)** \n\n### **Request for Additional Testing**\n\nEspersen and Bilinski were shocked and requested further testing to confirm the results. They asked for tissue samples to be taken, as this is considered the gold standard for diagnosing any illness. They wanted to determine whether it was avian flu or something else, possibly a bacterial infection, as the symptoms resembled those that affected the farm in 2020. At that time, an autopsy and tissue sampling were conducted, and the vet identified it as pseudomonas, a bacteria commonly found in soil and water.\n\nThe farmers asked for the same testing protocol to be applied in order to confirm the results, but CFIA denied their request.

However, this decision is not based on sound science and could have serious consequences for both food security and medical research.\nBackground on the Culling Order\nUniversal Ostrich Farm is a research facility focused on studying the unique antibody-producing capabilities of ostriches. Their research has demonstrated potential in neutralizing viruses, bacteria, and even COVID-19, making it an important contribution to medical science.\nIn December 2024, the CFIA claimed that two deceased ostriches—which had been lying outside for over 16 hours—tested positive for H5N1 via PCR testing.

However, this decision is not based on sound science and could have serious consequences for both food security and medical research.\n\n### **Background on the Culling Order**\n\nUniversal Ostrich Farm is a research facility focused on studying the unique antibody-producing capabilities of ostriches. Their research has demonstrated potential in neutralizing viruses, bacteria, and even COVID-19, making it an important contribution to medical science.\n\nIn December 2024, the CFIA claimed that two deceased ostriches—which had been lying outside for over 16 hours—tested positive for H5N1 via PCR testing. Just 41 minutes after receiving these results, the CFIA signed an order to cull the entire flock.\n\n### **Concerns Over This Decision**\n\n**Inconsistent Policy Changes** – The CFIA initially granted the farm an exemption, recognizing the birds as “genetically important.” Later, without clear justification, they reversed this decision, ordering their destruction.\n\n**Lack of Transparency and Scientific Process** – Despite the importance of this research, the CFIA has refused to conduct further testing on the birds and has banned the farm from conducting its own tests, under threat of heavy fines and possible imprisonment. Why is the Canadian government refusing to study the potential antibodies ostriches have developed against H5N1 bird flu?\n\n### **Legal Challenges and the Fight to Save the Ostriches**\n\n**Temporary Legal Victory** – On January 31, 2025, a court granted a temporary stay of execution, halting the cull. However, the CFIA is appealing this decision, which means the culling could still proceed.\n\n**Final Court Hearing in April** – The final judicial review is scheduled for April 17, 2025. This will be a pivotal moment in determining whether the farm will be allowed to continue its work or if the culling order will be upheld.\n\n### **Why This Matters**\n\nThis case is not just about one farm—it raises important questions about how governments handle disease outbreaks, the role of independent scientific research, and the future of food security.\n\n*   **If ostrich antibodies hold medical promise, why aren’t they being studied further?**\n*   **Why is the CFIA restricting independent testing instead of working with the farm?**\n*   **What precedent does this set for other farms and researchers facing similar government actions?**\n\nThis case marks a pivotal moment in the discussion on natural immunity, agricultural independence, and the future of disease management.

This case has sent alarm not just to farmers in Canada, but also to American farmers, as it demonstrates the increasing use of regulatory power to destroy independent farming and scientific advancement.\nIt began for Universal Ostrich Farm when an anonymous complaint was reported to the CFIA that there was a suspected Avian Influenza case on the farm. In the absence of precedent for Avian Influenza in Canadian ostriches, the CFIA acted expeditiously. The agency tested only two deceased birds via PCR tests, a method thoroughly discredited due to its significant false positive rate when used on unconventional hosts. Without conducting independent additional testing, and without confirming the actual cause of illness, the CFIA issued a demand to cull the entire flock.\nThe farm had once had a corresponding illness in December 2020, which proved to be the Pseudomonas bacteria. In that situation, most ostriches cleared up on their own, which demonstrated herd immunity. However, even with such a background, the CFIA ignored all competing explanations and pursued a mass cull order that comes across as having less to do with disease mitigation and more about exercising unfettered control of agricultural practices.\nIn addition to the immediate tragedy of potentially losing their entire flock, Universal Ostrich Farm’s work in research on antibodies renders this situation all the more devastating. Universal Ostrich Farm has set the pace in scientific innovation, extracting antibodies from ostrich eggs that have proven to be exceptionally valuable in combatting certain illnesses, including COVID-19. Their study proved that one ostrich egg holds the antibodies equivalent to 100 chicken eggs or the blood of 800 rabbits without the need to sacrifice them.\nMost importantly, their antibodies also turned out to be universally neutralizing against COVID-19 and all its variants. The success of the farm was suddenly cut short in a most unexpected manner when a cooperating laboratory was acquired by an outside agency and silenced under a non-disclosure agreement, a move that seriously calls into question whether powerful forces moved to silence this promising medical breakthrough.\nThe CFIA’s behavior is even more suspicious when taking into account the government’s interest in the research of the farm. In the initial talks, top officials pretended to be supportive and took intellectual property and business plans from the farm. However, even while promising to investigate the science, they had already signed the culling order, thus guaranteeing the killing of both the ostriches and the research of the farm.\nAdding to the intimidation, farm employees were supposedly interrogated as to where their COVID-19 antibodies were. The question remains: Was the culling order truly aimed at halting disease, or was it to cover up a scientific discovery that put vested pharmaceutical interests at risk?\nEven remarks from the CFIA contradict their aggressive actions. The agency admitted that if Avian Influenza actually existed, the entire flock would have died in 24-36 hours. But the reality could not be further from it—most ostriches never became ill, and those who did recovered. In addition, independent tests by farm hands concluded that there were birds that had antibodies to H5N1, signifying past exposure without illness, a direct opposite of the hype being pushed by regulators.\nFurther proving the absurdity of the fearmongering surrounding Avian Influenza, the entire family at Universal Ostrich Farm also tested positive for the antibodies, showing that they had been exposed at some point yet remained perfectly healthy and never fell ill. This raises serious questions about the severity of the disease and the motivations behind the Canadian government’s aggressive response.\nPeople are hospitalized from the flu every day, yet Avian Influenza has been selectively chosen as the latest tool of fear to control the populace. If we continue down this path of fear-driven policymaking, we risk backing ourselves into another pandemic response devoid of reason and education.\nAlso, the fact that the farm is located near a large population of migratory Mallard ducks—a known vector for avian diseases—was utterly disregarded by authorities. If the CFIA was truly concerned with preventing disease, a more scientific approach would have been to test the surrounding environment and other potential sources of contamination rather than calling for indiscriminate slaughter of an entire flock. The reality remains that as long as we have migratory birds, avian influenza will continue to exist, and the current approach of mass culling is unsustainable. Instead of destroying farms and wiping out food producers, new strategies must be developed to combat Avian Influenza effectively without dismantling agricultural operations worldwide.\nThe Universal Ostrich Farm case has to be an eye-opener for farming communities all over the world, and the United States, where the government interference chokes independent farmers at every step. The mass culling methods in Canada are not isolated; the same has occurred in the U.S., where the regulatory agencies exercise total powers in the guise of disease control, snatching the rights of family-run farms and scientific progress.\nIf the birds on Universal Ostrich Farm are destroyed, it will create a precedent that regulators can destroy agricultural businesses using weak evidence, and farmers are left subject to bureaucratic tyranny. This is not a fight about one farm—it is a fight about the future of independent producers in agriculture, food security, and the freedom of scientific innovation.\nWith a court of judicial review scheduled for April 15-16, Universal Ostrich Farm stands at a critical juncture: If the court upholds the CFIA, it will pave the way for more unjustified killings and potential suppression of scientific development in the fields of food and health security. But if the farm prevails, it will be a landmark victory for farmers’ rights and the fight against government overreach across the globe.\nFinancial support is critical in this battle. The farm is calling for donations and large-scale awareness to overturn this abuse of government power. Ostriches aside, this cause is about preserving the right to innovate, farm, and resist excessive regulations that erode the very essence of the independent producer in agriculture.\nIf Canada will not see the value in this science, perhaps America will. The silencing of Universal Ostrich Farm’s groundbreaking antibody research should be a concern for U.S. health advocates and policymakers, too. Imagine that these antibodies could turn everything around about how we combat infectious disease. Imagine that they might provide a better alternative to current ways of producing antibodies that is more effective for both humans and animals?\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., a vocal advocate for strict therapeutic drug testing and food sovereignty, might just have the solution for bringing Universal Ostrich Farm’s research to America. With American poultry flocks now under threat from the H5N1 bird flu, effective antibodies derived from ostrich eggs could be the missing link in disease prevention and treatment.\nWith individuals such as John Catsimatidis as potential intermediaries, this could prove to be one of the most historic scientific acquisitions in American history. It would not only secure America’s food supply but also position RFK Jr. as a key player in driving breakthroughs that defend farms and public health.\nA Call to Action:\nThe battle that Universal Ostrich Farm is fighting is not just for one farm or even a nation—it is to protect the fundamental rights of farmers, safeguard scientific progress, and oppose creeping authoritarianism that seeks to control agriculture in the guise of biosecurity.\nTime is running out. Universal Ostrich Farm is counting on the public to help bring an end to this government tyranny. If Canada fails to deliver justice in this case, perhaps the United States must step in to uphold a finding that holds promise for reforming food sovereignty and future medicines.\nWe must ask ourselves: Will we let regulatory agencies determine the destiny of scientific innovations, or will we resist the loss of our right to innovation, food sovereignty, and agricultural freedom?\nLearn more about this important mission by going to www.saveourostriches.com\nPLEASE donate to the family’s legal fund as they work to fight the unnecessary cull.\nGiveSendGo: Save Our Ostriches\nGoFundMe: SaveOstrichesfromUnnecessaryCull\nE-transfer: saveourostriches.gmail.com\nListen to the Connecting the Dots Radio podcast with Dan Happel to hear Katie Pasitney of Universal Ostrich Farm share her story about what is happening to her family. \nAGENDA 2030 vs HUMAN WELL BEING - Rumble \nsource: Connecting the Dots Radio Show","markdown":"# Targeted for Destruction: How Government Authorities Are Suspiciously Threatening an Ostrich Farm Leading the Way for Solutions to Disease\n\n![](https://saveourostriches.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-1-768x1024.png)\n\n[New Territory Media](https://www.newterritorymedia.com/targeted-for-destruction-how-government-authorities-are-suspiciously-threatening-an-ostrich-farm-leading-the-way-for-solutions-to-disease/) by [Mindy Patterson](https://www.newterritorymedia.com/author/mindy-patterson/)\n\nIn a horrific example of government overreach, Universal Ostrich Farm in Edgewood, British Columbia, faces the slaughter of nearly 400 ostriches due to a most dubious action by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

Without conducting independent additional testing, and without confirming the actual cause of illness, the CFIA issued a demand to cull the entire flock.\n\nThe farm had once had a corresponding illness in December 2020, which proved to be the Pseudomonas bacteria. In that situation, most ostriches cleared up on their own, which demonstrated herd immunity. However, even with such a background, the CFIA ignored all competing explanations and pursued a mass cull order that comes across as having less to do with disease mitigation and more about exercising unfettered control of agricultural practices.\n\nIn addition to the immediate tragedy of potentially losing their entire flock, Universal Ostrich Farm’s work in research on antibodies renders this situation all the more devastating. Universal Ostrich Farm has set the pace in scientific innovation, extracting antibodies from ostrich eggs that have proven to be exceptionally valuable in combatting certain illnesses, including COVID-19. Their study proved that one ostrich egg holds the antibodies equivalent to 100 chicken eggs or the blood of 800 rabbits without the need to sacrifice them.\n\nMost importantly, their antibodies also turned out to be universally neutralizing against COVID-19 and all its variants. The success of the farm was suddenly cut short in a most unexpected manner when a cooperating laboratory was acquired by an outside agency and silenced under a non-disclosure agreement, a move that seriously calls into question whether powerful forces moved to silence this promising medical breakthrough.\n\nThe CFIA’s behavior is even more suspicious when taking into account the government’s interest in the research of the farm. In the initial talks, top officials pretended to be supportive and took intellectual property and business plans from the farm. However, even while promising to investigate the science, they had already signed the culling order, thus guaranteeing the killing of both the ostriches and the research of the farm.\n\nAdding to the intimidation, farm employees were supposedly interrogated as to where their COVID-19 antibodies were. The question remains: Was the culling order truly aimed at halting disease, or was it to cover up a scientific discovery that put vested pharmaceutical interests at risk?\n\nEven remarks from the CFIA contradict their aggressive actions. The agency admitted that if Avian Influenza actually existed, the entire flock would have died in 24-36 hours. But the reality could not be further from it—most ostriches never became ill, and those who did recovered. In addition, independent tests by farm hands concluded that there were birds that had antibodies to H5N1, signifying past exposure without illness, a direct opposite of the hype being pushed by regulators.\n\nFurther proving the absurdity of the fearmongering surrounding Avian Influenza, the entire family at Universal Ostrich Farm also tested positive for the antibodies, showing that they had been exposed at some point yet remained perfectly healthy and never fell ill. This raises serious questions about the severity of the disease and the motivations behind the Canadian government’s aggressive response.\n\nPeople are hospitalized from the flu every day, yet Avian Influenza has been selectively chosen as the latest tool of fear to control the populace. If we continue down this path of fear-driven policymaking, we risk backing ourselves into another pandemic response devoid of reason and education.\n\nAlso, the fact that the farm is located near a large population of migratory Mallard ducks—a known vector for avian diseases—was utterly disregarded by authorities. If the CFIA was truly concerned with preventing disease, a more scientific approach would have been to test the surrounding environment and other potential sources of contamination rather than calling for indiscriminate slaughter of an entire flock. The reality remains that as long as we have migratory birds, avian influenza will continue to exist, and the current approach of mass culling is unsustainable. Instead of destroying farms and wiping out food producers, new strategies must be developed to combat Avian Influenza effectively without dismantling agricultural operations worldwide.\n\nThe Universal Ostrich Farm case has to be an eye-opener for farming communities all over the world, and the United States, where the government interference chokes independent farmers at every step. The mass culling methods in Canada are not isolated; the same has occurred in the U.S., where the regulatory agencies exercise total powers in the guise of disease control, snatching the rights of family-run farms and scientific progress.\n\nIf the birds on Universal Ostrich Farm are destroyed, it will create a precedent that regulators can destroy agricultural businesses using weak evidence, and farmers are left subject to bureaucratic tyranny. This is not a fight about one farm—it is a fight about the future of independent producers in agriculture, food security, and the freedom of scientific innovation.\n\nWith a court of judicial review scheduled for April 15-16, Universal Ostrich Farm stands at a critical juncture: If the court upholds the CFIA, it will pave the way for more unjustified killings and potential suppression of scientific development in the fields of food and health security. But if the farm prevails, it will be a landmark victory for farmers’ rights and the fight against government overreach across the globe.\n\nFinancial support is critical in this battle. The farm is calling for donations and large-scale awareness to overturn this abuse of government power. Ostriches aside, this cause is about preserving the right to innovate, farm, and resist excessive regulations that erode the very essence of the independent producer in agriculture.\n\nIf Canada will not see the value in this science, perhaps America will. The silencing of Universal Ostrich Farm’s groundbreaking antibody research should be a concern for U.S. health advocates and policymakers, too. Imagine that these antibodies could turn everything around about how we combat infectious disease. Imagine that they might provide a better alternative to current ways of producing antibodies that is more effective for both humans and animals?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., a vocal advocate for strict therapeutic drug testing and food sovereignty, might just have the solution for bringing Universal Ostrich Farm’s research to America. With American poultry flocks now under threat from the H5N1 bird flu, effective antibodies derived from ostrich eggs could be the missing link in disease prevention and treatment.\n\nWith individuals such as John Catsimatidis as potential intermediaries, this could prove to be one of the most historic scientific acquisitions in American history. It would not only secure America’s food supply but also position RFK Jr. as a key player in driving breakthroughs that defend farms and public health.\n\n**A Call to Action:**\n\nThe battle that Universal Ostrich Farm is fighting is not just for one farm or even a nation—it is to protect the fundamental rights of farmers, safeguard scientific progress, and oppose creeping authoritarianism that seeks to control agriculture in the guise of biosecurity.\n\nTime is running out. Universal Ostrich Farm is counting on the public to help bring an end to this government tyranny. If Canada fails to deliver justice in this case, perhaps the United States must step in to uphold a finding that holds promise for reforming food sovereignty and future medicines.\n\nWe must ask ourselves: Will we let regulatory agencies determine the destiny of scientific innovations, or will we resist the loss of our right to innovation, food sovereignty, and agricultural freedom?\n\nLearn more about this important mission by going to [www.saveourostriches.com](http://www.saveourostriches.com/)\n\nPLEASE donate to the family’s legal fund as they work to fight the unnecessary cull.\n\n**GiveSendGo**: [Save Our Ostriches](https://www.givesendgo.com/save-our-ostriches)  \n**GoFundMe:** [SaveOstrichesfromUnnecessaryCull](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ostrich-farmers-fight-to-save-herd-from-avian-flu?attribution_id=sl%3A80e09934-7413-429b-acfb-2f7015cc19d3&lang=en_CA)  \n**E-transfer:** saveourostriches.gmail.com\n\nListen to the Connecting the Dots Radio podcast with Dan Happel to hear Katie Pasitney of Universal Ostrich Farm share her story about what is happening to her family.\n\nAGENDA 2030 vs HUMAN WELL BEING - Rumble  \n\nsource: [Connecting the Dots Radio Show](https://rumble.com/v6rfiu4-agenda-2030-vs-human-well-being.html?start=57)","debug":{"requestHandlerMode":"browser"}}

The Evolving Landscape of H5N1 Avian Influenza in Canada and the United States: A May 2025 AssessmentI. Executive SummaryAs of May 2025, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus presents a complex and evolving challenge across North America. In both Canada and the United States, the virus is extensively distributed within wild bird populations, which serve as persistent reservoirs, leading to recurrent outbreaks in domestic poultry. The scale of these poultry outbreaks is notably larger in the United States, with significant economic repercussions, particularly for the egg industry. A critical divergence in the epidemiological landscape is the emergence and widespread transmission of H5N1 within U.S. dairy cattle herds since March 2024, a situation that, despite extensive surveillance, has not been mirrored in Canadian dairy cattle. This development in the U.S. has introduced new transmission dynamics and pathways for human exposure.Sporadic human cases of H5N1, primarily linked to direct contact with infected animals (poultry and, in the U.S., dairy cattle), have been reported in both nations. While these cases are infrequent and no sustained human-to-human transmission has been identified, the detection of viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation in some human isolates underscores the zoonotic potential and the imperative for ongoing vigilance. Public health agencies in both countries currently assess the risk to the general public as low, though it is elevated for individuals with occupational or direct exposure to infected animals.Governmental responses in Canada and the United States involve substantial financial investment and multi-agency efforts focused on surveillance, outbreak control through measures like culling and quarantine, biosecurity enhancement, public health guidance, and research into viral evolution and countermeasures, including vaccines. The economic impacts are considerable, ranging from direct losses in the poultry and dairy sectors to broader effects on food prices and international trade. The continuous evolution of the H5N1 virus, its expanding host range, and its capacity for interspecies transmission necessitate robust, adaptive, and collaborative One Health approaches to monitor and mitigate the multifaceted risks it poses to animal health, agricultural stability, and public health.II. Current Status of H5N1 Avian Influenza in Canada (as of May 2025)A. Outbreaks in Poultry and Other Domestic BirdsCanada continues to experience H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks across its diverse poultry sector, impacting various types of operations and geographic regions. As of May 16, 2025, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) reported 18 active infected poultry premises (IPs) across the country. Cumulatively, 520 premises had been infected and subsequently released from quarantine, with the total number of birds affected by mortality or depopulation reaching 14,566,000.1 Data from May 1, 2025, indicated 14 current outbreaks in Canadian poultry.2The provincial distribution of these active infections as of mid-May 2025 highlights the widespread nature of the issue: Alberta and British Columbia each had two current IPs; Manitoba, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia also reported two IPs each. Ontario had the highest number with four current IPs, while Prince Edward Island had one, and Saskatchewan reported three. Quebec and New Brunswick had no current IPs listed at that time.1Table 1: H5N1 Detections in Canadian Domestic Bird Flocks by Province (as of May 16, 2025)ProvinceNumber of current infected premises (IPs)Number of previously infected premises (released IPs)Estimated number of birds impactedAlberta2852,019,000British Columbia22378,735,000Manitoba224408,000New Brunswick02Under 100Newfoundland and Labrador22400Nova Scotia2812,000Ontario4571,175,000Prince Edward Island10200Quebec0591,465,500Saskatchewan346751,000Total1852014,566,000Source: 1Recent incidents underscore the ongoing activity. In Saskatchewan, testing confirmed the H5 strain of avian flu in hundreds of dead Ross's geese found near Lipton in spring 2025. This event led to the quarantine of three farms: one in the Rural Municipality (RM) of Lipton (a non-commercial, non-poultry premise), one in the RM of Colonsay (a non-commercial poultry operation), and a third in the RM of Indian Head.3 The Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment characterized the scale of wild goose mortality as unusual for the spring season, exceeding typical levels though not reaching the peaks observed in 2022 when the virus was newer to Canadian bird populations.3 The strain identified in the Lipton-area geese was reported to be the same as that detected at a British Columbia ostrich farm.3 This ostrich farm, Universal Ostrich Farms in Edgewood, B.C., became the subject of a CFIA-ordered cull after 69 birds died in December and January. The cull proceeded despite requests from the farm owners and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to spare the remaining 400 birds for scientific study, as the owners believed they had acquired herd immunity.4In Ontario, the winter 2024–2025 season saw 12 poultry premises (11 commercial flocks and 1 small flock) in the southern part of the province confirmed with HPAI H5N1. All affected flocks were depopulated, and the premises were placed under CFIA quarantine as per federal eradication policy.6 Beyond H5N1, the CFIA also detected low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) subtype H5 in Quebec on November 25, 2024, and confirmed HPAI H5N5 in poultry in Newfoundland and Labrador on February 12, 2025, indicating surveillance and detection of multiple avian influenza subtypes.7The continued emergence of H5N1 in diverse Canadian poultry operations, spanning commercial, non-commercial, and even non-poultry premises across multiple provinces 1, occurs despite established biosecurity protocols and active responses by the CFIA.1 This pattern underscores the persistent threat posed by wild bird reservoirs, which serve as a continuous source of viral introduction. Furthermore, these ongoing outbreaks point to the inherent difficulties in maintaining infallible biosecurity across all agricultural settings and the potential for environmental contamination to facilitate viral spread. The quarantine of a non-commercial, non-poultry premise in Saskatchewan 3, for instance, illustrates the virus's capacity to surface in less conventional settings, thereby broadening the scope of surveillance and control challenges.The situation at the B.C. ostrich farm, which involved public protests and a high-profile request for sparing birds for research 4, brings to light the complex socio-political and ethical dimensions that can overlay outbreak management. Such events can add significant pressure to authorities tasked with disease control. Reports of CFIA staff facing "intimidation and threats" in relation to the planned cull 5 further emphasize the human stress and operational difficulties encountered during these responses, extending beyond purely epizootiological considerations.B. Surveillance and Detections in Wild Bird PopulationsWild birds are the primary natural reservoir for H5N1 viruses, and their migratory movements are a principal driver of the virus's geographic dissemination, posing an ongoing threat to domestic poultry and other susceptible species. Surveillance data from Canada indicate continued viral circulation at significant levels in these populations.In Saskatchewan, the discovery of hundreds of dead Ross's geese near Lipton in spring 2025, which subsequently tested positive for the H5 strain of avian flu, was a notable event.3 Wildlife health specialists with the provincial Ministry of Environment described an "unusual to see this scale of mortality" and an general increase in mortality within wild bird populations, although these levels had not reached the highs of 2022.3 Professor Trent Bollinger of the Western College of Veterinary Medicine and the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) corroborated this, noting an increase in dead birds submitted for avian flu testing and autopsies. He anticipated a decline in these numbers as migratory seasons conclude and pointed out that Alberta was not experiencing a similar surge, potentially due to differing goose flyways.3 This observation directly illustrates how avian migration routes influence the local intensity of H5N1 circulation, with clear implications for targeted surveillance and the timing of biosecurity advisories for poultry producers, which should be heightened during peak migration periods along known flyways. The CFIA has also acknowledged that climate change may affect wild bird migration patterns, potentially increasing the scale and frequency of H5N1 outbreaks.9Cumulatively, since November 3, 2021, the CWHC has reported 2,537 positive HPAI detections in wild birds across Canada, with 413 of these occurring in Ontario.6 For the period between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 52 of 2024, Canada reported 120 HPAI A(H5N1) outbreaks in poultry and wild birds to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) across 11 provinces and territories.10 More recently, between EW 1 and EW 8 of 2025, Canada reported seven HPAI A(H5N1) outbreaks in poultry to WOAH, located in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec.11The reports of "hundreds of dead birds reported at sites" 3 in Saskatchewan geese suggest that the circulating H5N1 strains possess high virulence in these wild populations, not solely in domestic poultry. Such significant mortality events in wild birds lead to a higher environmental viral load, thereby increasing the risk of spillover into domestic animal populations and potentially to humans.C. Detections in Mammalian Species (Non-Human)A critical point of distinction between the H5N1 situation in Canada and the United States is the status of dairy cattle. As of early 2025, the HPAI virus genotype B3.13, which has been found in U.S. dairy cattle, had not been detected in Canadian birds, cattle, or any other animals.7 This remains the case as of May 26, 2025, with no H5N1 cases identified in Canadian dairy cattle.12 This absence is supported by extensive surveillance: by May 8, 2025, CFIA laboratories had tested 3,498 raw milk samples collected from trucks arriving at processing plants in all provinces, with all samples testing negative.12 Similarly, 1,211 retail milk samples tested by September 5, 2024, were also all negative.13 This robust and proactive surveillance of the Canadian dairy sector, particularly the widespread milk testing initiative, demonstrates a significant effort to monitor for any introduction of the virus, especially in light of the U.S. situation. The consistent negative results provide strong evidence that widespread infection, akin to that in U.S. dairy herds, has not occurred in Canada to date.Despite the absence in cattle, Canada has reported H5N1 in other mammalian species. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) indicated that between 2022 and EW 52 of 2024, Canada was among eight countries in the Americas reporting H5N1 outbreaks in mammals. The PAHO report attributed 982 such "outbreaks" in mammals to Canada during 2024 alone.10 This figure appears exceptionally high and likely requires careful interpretation; it may represent the aggregation of individual wild mammal detections (e.g., skunks, foxes) reported to WOAH, rather than distinct outbreaks in managed or domestic mammal populations. This contrasts with the clear definition of herd outbreaks in the U.S. dairy context. Specific reports confirm HPAI A(H5N1) infections in foxes in Canada.14 The CFIA is actively monitoring the global situation regarding H5N1 in various wild and domestic mammalian species.6 The Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative dashboard serves as a resource for details on these wild mammal detections.16 Clarifying the nature of these mammal "outbreaks" is important to accurately represent Canada's H5N1 status in mammals relative to the U.S. dairy crisis.D. Human Cases and Public Health Risk AssessmentCanada has recorded its first domestically acquired human case of avian influenza A(H5N1). On November 13, 2024, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) confirmed the infection in a teenage girl in British Columbia who was subsequently hospitalized.2 Genomic sequencing of the virus from this case linked it to the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.1, which was circulating in poultry in the region. Notably, the virus also possessed the E627K mutation in the PB2 gene, a marker associated with increased viral replication in mammals.11 The precise source of her infection remains unknown, and no additional related cases have been reported.11 This case is significant not only as the first domestic acquisition in Canada but also because the detected viral mutation signals a potential shift in local viral characteristics and exposure risks, warranting heightened vigilance.Despite this case, PHAC maintains that the overall risk of A(H5N1) infection to people in Canada remains low.17 However, the agency acknowledges an increased risk for individuals who have higher levels of exposure to infected animals or highly contaminated environments.17 Crucially, there is currently no evidence to suggest that the H5N1 virus is capable of spreading efficiently and sustainably among humans.17In terms of preparedness, PHAC has taken proactive steps, including the purchase of 500,000 doses of human vaccine against avian influenza. These vaccines are held for potential use should the public health threat escalate, for example, if sustained human-to-human transmission were to occur.17 This procurement, despite the current low-risk assessment for the general populace, indicates that Canadian health authorities are actively preparing for scenarios where the risk profile could change.E. National Response: CFIA and PHAC Strategies and Control MeasuresCanada's response to H5N1 avian influenza is a coordinated federal effort, primarily led by the CFIA for animal health aspects and PHAC for human health. A significant financial commitment underpins these efforts, with $27.9 million allocated for the 2024-2025 fiscal year to support early detection, active prevention, and rapid response measures for HPAI A(H5N1).9The overarching goals of this strategy include maintaining the current response to poultry outbreaks, ensuring timely emergency preparedness and response to protect both human and animal health, minimizing viral transmission in domestic poultry, reducing the threat to cattle and other animals, safeguarding the food supply, maintaining public health, preserving export markets for Canadian poultry and dairy products, minimizing financial burdens on affected sectors, and enhancing research and surveillance systems.9Key activities undertaken by the CFIA include responding to detections of both HPAI and LPAI subtype H5 in domestic birds.1 This involves the humane depopulation of infected flocks to prevent further spread 9, rigorous promotion of on-farm biosecurity measures 1, and comprehensive surveillance programs. A notable component of this surveillance is the proactive testing of milk from dairy cattle, which, as previously mentioned, has consistently yielded negative results.12 The CFIA also supports research initiatives and efforts towards animal vaccine development.9 Furthermore, to protect national animal health, the agency restricts the import of bird by-products from international regions experiencing active HPAI outbreaks.1PHAC is responsible for public health risk assessments, providing guidance to the public and healthcare professionals, monitoring for human cases of A(H5N1), and coordinating the public health response if cases occur.17 The agency's preparedness measures include the strategic stockpiling of human H5N1 vaccines.17This comprehensive approach reflects an understanding of the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, often referred to as a "One Health" strategy. The allocation of dedicated funding and the specific objectives aimed at protecting the dairy sector and supporting animal vaccine development suggest that Canada's strategy is, in part, informed by and learning from the H5N1 developments in the United States, particularly the dairy cattle outbreak.An important dimension of Canada's long-term strategic planning is the acknowledged potential influence of climate change on H5N1 epidemiology. CFIA documents note that climate change may alter wild bird migration patterns and that increasing temperatures and changing ecosystems could potentially increase the scale and frequency of H5N1 outbreaks, as well as the likelihood of viral mutation.9 While recognizing that scientific research on this linkage is still evolving, the inclusion of this factor in funding proposals and strategic considerations indicates a forward-looking approach that incorporates broader environmental drivers into national disease management planning.III. Current Status of H5N1 Avian Influenza in the United States (as of May 2025)The United States is confronting a significant and widespread HPAI H5N1 epizootic, characterized by extensive outbreaks in poultry, the novel emergence and spread in dairy cattle, and detections across a diverse range of wild bird and other mammalian species.A. Nationwide Outbreaks in Commercial and Backyard PoultryThe impact of HPAI H5N1 on the U.S. poultry industry has been substantial and geographically widespread. As of May 20, 2025, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that 171,554,878 poultry had been affected across 51 jurisdictions since the beginning of the current outbreak wave on February 8, 2022.23 More recent figures focusing on the period since April 2024, reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS), detailed H5 virus detections in 336 commercial flocks and 207 backyard flocks, impacting over 90.9 million birds.25 An earlier count, as of November 20, 2024, cited 108,412,219 birds affected in commercial and backyard flocks across nearly all U.S. states since early 2022.26 Another report from March 2025 stated that 166.16 million birds (764 commercial flocks, 841 backyard flocks) had been affected since February 2022.27 These figures, while varying slightly due to different reporting periods and cumulative totals, collectively paint a picture of an immense challenge to the poultry sector.Recent detections in late May 2025 continued to affirm the virus's activity, with confirmations in live bird markets in Queens County, New York, and a backyard flock in Jefferson County, New York. Concurrently, outbreaks were identified at a poultry farm in Curry County, New Mexico, and a backyard flock in Roosevelt County, New Mexico.28 The persistence of H5N1 in live bird markets is a particular concern, as these environments, where birds from diverse origins are congregated, can act as significant amplification points and hubs for viral dissemination, necessitating targeted surveillance and stringent biosecurity within these specific market systems.In response to this crisis, the USDA is leveraging substantial resources, including a $1 billion investment aimed at curbing HPAI, protecting the U.S. poultry industry, and mitigating the impact on consumer egg prices. This funding supports enhanced biosecurity measures on farms and provides financial relief to affected producers.27 It is also important to note that surveillance efforts are not limited to H5N1; for instance, APHIS confirmed an outbreak of H7N9 HPAI in a U.S. flock on March 17, 2025, indicating broader vigilance for various HPAI strains.29The sheer scale of poultry affected—over 170 million birds 23—and the geographical extent of outbreaks across almost all states 26 over several years underscore the extreme difficulty in controlling and eradicating the virus from this sector once it has been widely introduced. Despite extensive federal financial investment and control efforts, including depopulation and biosecurity promotion, new outbreaks continue to emerge. This highlights the immense challenge posed by factors such as the vast and mobile wild bird reservoir, the virus's environmental resilience, and the complexities of ensuring perfect biosecurity across a large and diverse national industry. The fact that 67 commercial poultry farms have experienced reinfection at least twice, with 19 of those farms being infected three or more times during the current outbreak 27, starkly illustrates this persistent challenge.B. Emergence and Spread in Dairy Cattle and Other LivestockA pivotal development in the North American H5N1 situation was the first-ever confirmation of the virus in U.S. dairy cattle on March 25, 2024.32 Since this initial detection, the virus has spread significantly within this new host population. As of May 22, 2025, 1,070 dairy herds across 17 states were reported by the CDC as affected.23 Other USDA APHIS updates around the same period provided similar figures, with slight variations depending on the exact reporting date (e.g., 1,009 herds in 17 states 28; 1,020 herds in 17 states 34). Specific state counts include California with 766 affected herds and Idaho with 100.33In response to this novel emergence, the USDA implemented critical regulatory and surveillance measures. An April 2024 Federal Order mandated pre-movement testing for H5N1 in lactating dairy cattle moving interstate.32 This was followed by a December 2024 Federal Order establishing a National Milk Testing Strategy, which involves comprehensive surveillance of the nation's milk supply.32 A voluntary Dairy Herd Status Program was also introduced, offering producers the option of weekly bulk tank milk testing to facilitate interstate movement; approximately 100 herds across 18 states were enrolled in this program.35Clinical presentation in affected dairy cattle typically includes decreased appetite, reduced milk production, and changes in milk consistency (thickened, discolored, colostrum-like). Lethargy and fever may also occur. While morbidity can be high within affected herds, the virus has generally not been highly pathogenic in cattle, with most animals recovering with supportive care and a low mortality or culling rate, reported at 2% or less on average.32Genomic analysis has revealed some evolution of the virus within the dairy cattle population. The initial H5N1 clade identified in cattle was 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13. Subsequently, a second genotype, D1.1—which was the predominant genotype circulating in North American wild bird flyways during the fall and winter of 2024-2025 and has been identified in wild birds, mammals, and poultry spillovers—was confirmed in dairy cattle in Nevada and Arizona.33 The presence of multiple H5N1 genotypes in dairy cattle suggests either multiple independent spillover events from different avian sources or potential evolution and reassortment of the virus within the cattle population itself. This genetic diversity adds complexity to control strategies and vaccine development considerations.Regarding transmission dynamics, USDA APHIS has indicated that continued regional spread between dairy farms is likely associated with normal operational movements of cattle, people, vehicles, and equipment, rather than direct spillover from migratory waterfowl onto dairy premises.32 This suggests that once H5N1 was introduced into the dairy system, lateral spread mechanisms (cow-to-cow or indirect transmission via fomites) became efficient drivers of the epidemic within this novel host. This is a critical distinction from many poultry outbreaks that are often directly linked to wild bird activity.Beyond dairy cattle, H5N1 has also been detected in other U.S. livestock, albeit more sporadically. In late 2024 (October-November), the virus was found in two pigs on a non-commercial backyard farm in Oregon where poultry on the same premises were also infected with H5N1.10 Additionally, HPAI A(H5N1) has been reported in goats.14 The USDA is providing financial assistance to dairy producers to help offset losses from reduced milk production, cover costs for enhanced biosecurity, and support testing efforts.29Recent modeling studies, such as one published in Nature Communications in May 2025 (based on research from January 2025), suggest that current mitigation measures for dairy cattle, primarily focused on testing for interstate movement, may be insufficient to control the epidemic. The model indicates a likelihood of significant underreporting of infections and predicts continued spread throughout 2025, highlighting states like Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, and Indiana as being at high risk for future outbreaks.39 This suggests that the existing federal orders, while important, might not be adequate to halt viral transmission within the highly interconnected U.S. dairy system without further enhancements to farm-level biosecurity and more comprehensive surveillance strategies.C. Surveillance and Detections in Wild Bird PopulationsWild birds remain the principal reservoir for H5N1 viruses in the United States, continuously seeding the environment and posing an ongoing risk to domestic animal populations. As of May 22, 2025, the CDC reported 13,037 detections of H5N1 in wild birds across 51 jurisdictions since January 20, 2022.23 The USDA APHIS maintains a Wild Bird Surveillance Dashboard, which provides detailed information on these detections, including species, location, and date, often clustered by county.29 Recent HPAI detections in May 2025, for example, included species such as house sparrows and common grackles in South Dakota, black vultures in Florida, Canada geese and blue jays in Iowa, and a bald eagle in North Carolina.42The USDA APHIS wild bird surveillance program serves as an essential early warning system for the introduction and distribution of avian influenza viruses of concern.43 The currently circulating H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is understood to have spread to North America in 2021 via waterfowl flyways from Europe, Africa, and Asia.10The diversity of wild bird species affected by H5N1 in the U.S. is noteworthy. While waterfowl (ducks, geese, swans) and raptors (eagles, hawks) are commonly associated with HPAI, detections in passerine species such as house sparrows and blue jays 42 suggest a broadening ecological niche for the virus. These smaller bird species often live in closer proximity to human dwellings, backyard poultry, and livestock facilities than some migratory waterfowl, potentially creating different or more frequent interfaces for viral spillover. This expansion of the wild bird host range could complicate risk assessments and control efforts.Long-term surveillance data from wild bird populations are critical for understanding viral evolution, persistence, and spread dynamics. However, it is noted by APHIS that the prioritization of HPAI testing may lead to delays in reporting for other avian influenza viruses (AIVs).41 While this prioritization is understandable in the context of an HPAI emergency, it could potentially reduce real-time visibility into the circulation and evolution of other AIVs, including low pathogenic H5 or H7 strains that have the potential to mutate into highly pathogenic forms. A fully comprehensive risk picture benefits from timely data on all relevant AIVs circulating in wild bird reservoirs.D. Detections in Other Mammalian Species (including domestic pets)The H5N1 virus has demonstrated a concerning ability to infect a wide array of mammalian species in the United States, beyond livestock. Since 2022, USDA APHIS has reported HPAI A(H5N1) in over 200 individual mammals across numerous species.14 This list includes domestic cats; wild felids such as mountain lions, tigers, leopards, and bobcats; various carnivores like skunks, red and Arctic foxes, raccoons, black and brown bears, polar bears, American marten, American mink, fisher, and North American river otter; marine mammals including grey seals, harbor seals, and bottlenose dolphins; and other species such as Virginia opossums, squirrels, desert cottontails, and various mouse species.14Domestic cats have been particularly affected, with the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirming over 130 feline cases of HPAI H5N1 since December 2022.46 Cats are described as "exquisitely sensitive" to the virus 46, and infections have often been severe, leading to neurological signs and death.33 A significant transmission route for these feline infections has been identified as the consumption of contaminated raw animal products. Specifically, H5N1 has been found in cats that died after consuming raw colostrum or unpasteurized milk from infected dairy cows.33 Contaminated raw meat pet food has also been implicated, leading to product recalls, such as for Savage Cat Food.46 This establishes a clear foodborne pathway for H5N1 transmission to susceptible mammals, which has direct implications for pet owners, especially in areas where H5N1 is circulating in dairy cattle or poultry.Recent mammalian detections reported in April 2025 further illustrate the ongoing spillover, with cases in domestic cats in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Illinois; skunks in New Mexico and Texas; house mice in Iowa; an Arctic fox in Alaska; a red fox in New York; a raccoon in Kentucky; and a bobcat in Connecticut.47While cats are generally considered to be dead-end hosts for avian influenza viruses, meaning they do not typically contribute significantly to onward transmission of the virus 46, the frequency and severity of infections are cause for concern regarding animal welfare and potential human exposure from close contact with infected pets.The increasing number and variety of wild mammal species found infected with H5N1 suggest that the virus is frequently spilling over from infected birds, likely through predation or scavenging of infected carcasses. While many of these infected wild mammals may also be dead-end hosts, sustained circulation within certain wildlife populations could potentially lead to viral adaptation within those species. Such adaptation could alter transmission dynamics, create new environmental reservoirs, or even facilitate pathways for the virus to re-transmit to other animal species, including domestic animals or humans. This broad host range in mammals underscores the virus's adaptability and the complexity of its ecological footprint.E. Human Cases and Public Health Risk AssessmentWhile H5N1 avian influenza primarily affects birds and other animals, sporadic human infections continue to be a significant public health concern in the United States, particularly given the virus's evolving nature and expanding host range. From 2022 to mid-April 2025, a total of 71 human cases of influenza A(H5) were identified in the U.S..50 Focusing on the period since the emergence of H5N1 in dairy cattle, 70 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) were reported between April 2024 and May 2025.11 Of these 70 recent cases, 41 were associated with exposure to infected dairy cows, 26 were linked to exposure to infected poultry, and for three cases, the source of exposure could not be determined.25 One fatality was reported in 2025: a senior in Louisiana with underlying medical conditions who was hospitalized with HPAI H5N1 after exposure to backyard poultry flocks and wild birds.6A critical development was the confirmation by the CDC of a human HPAI A(H5N1) infection in a dairy worker in Texas, which is considered the first instance of likely mammal-to-human transmission of this virus.14 This shift in exposure source, with dairy cattle now accounting for the majority of recent human cases, has altered the risk landscape for specific occupational groups. Dairy workers now face a heightened risk, necessitating targeted occupational health guidance and protective measures.Despite these human infections, the CDC has consistently assessed the current public health risk to the general U.S. population as low.23 However, for populations with direct or prolonged exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments—such as poultry workers, dairy workers, and animal health responders—the risk is assessed as moderate to high.25 Crucially, to date, no confirmed or sustained human-to-human transmission of the A(H5) virus has been identified in the United States.25CDC's national influenza surveillance systems, including FluSurv-NET, have shown no indicators of unusual influenza activity in the general human population, including any signals of widespread A(H5) circulation.23 Extensive monitoring of individuals exposed to infected animals is ongoing. As of May 23, 2025, at least 26,000 people had been monitored post-exposure since February 2022, with 1,180 of them being tested for novel influenza A. Since the dairy outbreak began in March 2024, at least 16,700 people have been monitored (including 9,300 with dairy cow exposures), and at least 880 have been tested (including 218 with dairy cow exposures).24 The relatively small number of confirmed human cases resulting from this large pool of monitored and tested individuals suggests that current H5N1 strains are not highly transmissible to humans, that many infections may be asymptomatic or very mild and thus go undetected, or that recommended personal protective equipment and precautions are providing some level of protection in high-exposure settings. The CDC has recently expanded its testing recommendations to include offering tests to asymptomatic individuals who have had a high likelihood of unprotected exposure to the H5N1 virus, aiming to better capture the full spectrum of infection.51Genetic analyses of viruses isolated from some human cases have revealed mutations of concern. For instance, viruses from human cases in Wyoming and Nevada exhibited mutations previously associated with more efficient H5N1 virus replication in mammalian cells and in humans.51 However, the virus sequenced from a more recent human case in Ohio (clade 2.3.4.4b, D1.3 genotype) did not show any genetic markers that would negatively impact the effectiveness of existing influenza antiviral medications or candidate vaccine viruses, nor did it exhibit changes suggesting better adaptation to spread among or infect mammals.25 This underscores the importance of continuous genomic surveillance, as each human infection provides an opportunity for the virus to acquire mutations that could enhance its adaptation to mammalian hosts, including humans.Currently available FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications, such as oseltamivir, are effective against the H5N1 strains circulating in the U.S. These medications are recommended for the treatment of confirmed or suspected H5N1 virus infection and can also be used for post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals who have had unprotected exposure to infected animals.51Table 2: Overview of H5N1 Detections in U.S. Animal Populations (Cumulative/Recent as of May 2025)

Sources: 14F. National Response: USDA, CDC, and FDA Strategies and Control MeasuresThe U.S. response to the H5N1 avian influenza situation is a large-scale, multi-agency effort involving the USDA, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reflecting the multifaceted nature of the threat to animal health, public health, and the food supply. This response has been characterized by the rapid deployment of regulatory measures, extensive financial support for affected industries, and an adaptive approach to surveillance and research.USDA APHIS spearheads the animal health response. This includes comprehensive surveillance programs for H5N1 in commercial and backyard poultry, wild bird populations, dairy cattle, and other susceptible mammals.14 Outbreak control measures primarily involve the depopulation of infected poultry flocks to prevent further spread.32 APHIS also provides substantial financial assistance and biosecurity support to poultry and dairy producers to mitigate losses and enhance on-farm protective measures.27The CDC leads the human public health response. This encompasses active surveillance for human cases, including monitoring individuals with known exposures to infected animals, and utilizing existing influenza surveillance networks like FluSurv-NET to detect any unusual activity.23 The CDC conducts laboratory testing for H5N1 in human samples, performs viral genomic sequencing, and undertakes risk assessments to inform public health strategy.23 Extensive guidance is provided to the general public, healthcare providers, and laboratories on prevention, diagnosis, and management of H5N1.23The FDA focuses on the safety of the U.S. food supply. This includes conducting research on the inactivation of the H5N1 virus in milk and dairy products, confirming the effectiveness of pasteurization.13 The FDA also issues guidance for dairy processors and pet food manufacturers concerning H5N1 risks and mitigation.61Key regulatory measures implemented include the USDA's Federal Orders requiring H5N1 testing for interstate movement of lactating dairy cattle and mandating reporting of positive results.32 The National Milk Testing Strategy further enhances surveillance in the dairy sector.32 An adaptive component of the surveillance strategy is the incorporation of H5 avian influenza A virus testing into the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS).24 While interpretation of wastewater data is complex as it cannot definitively distinguish between human and animal sources, it provides a broad, community-level indicator of viral circulation that can complement other surveillance methods and potentially identify areas requiring more targeted investigation.Significant investments are also being made in research and development, including efforts to advance animal and human vaccine candidates.27 The scale of financial commitment, such as the USDA's allocation of over $1 billion for the HPAI response 27, underscores the perceived high economic and potential public health threat, particularly following the virus's jump to dairy cattle. This level of intervention reflects an urgent attempt to control a rapidly evolving epizootic.While rapid outbreak control measures like culling are essential for limiting viral spread, there is an inherent tension with the scientific desire to study naturally exposed or potentially resistant animals. This was evident in the debate surrounding the B.C. ostrich farm 4 and is implicitly relevant to the U.S. situation with massive poultry culls and widespread cattle infections. The imperative for swift depopulation can sometimes conflict with valuable opportunities to research natural infection dynamics, host resistance mechanisms, and viral evolution in real-time within these large animal populations, a persistent challenge in managing fast-moving epizootics.IV. Comparative Analysis and Transboundary ConsiderationsA. Contrasting National Epidemiological LandscapesWhile both Canada and the United States grapple with HPAI H5N1, notable differences exist in their respective epidemiological situations as of May 2025. The most striking divergence lies in the dairy cattle sector. The U.S. is experiencing widespread H5N1 infection in its dairy herds, with 1,070 herds across 17 states affected by late May 2025.23 In stark contrast, Canada has reported no confirmed cases of H5N1 in its dairy cattle population, a status maintained despite extensive and proactive surveillance, including widespread testing of raw milk samples.7 This significant difference, despite the interconnected agricultural systems and shared ecosystems of the two countries, suggests that either the specific transmission dynamics facilitating efficient spread within U.S. dairies are not yet replicated in Canada, that Canadian biosecurity enhancements and surveillance have been preemptively effective in preventing establishment, or that subtle viral or host factors may be at play.Both nations continue to experience H5N1 outbreaks in their poultry sectors. However, the scale of these outbreaks is vastly larger in the United States, both in terms of the number of birds affected (over 171 million in the U.S. compared to approximately 14.5 million in Canada since the start of their respective outbreak waves) and the number of infected premises.1 This disparity likely reflects differences in the overall scale of their poultry industries, variations in the intensity of viral pressure from wild bird migratory routes, diverse farm management and housing systems, and potentially differences in reporting or detection efficiencies.Regarding human health, both countries have reported sporadic human cases of H5N1. The U.S. has recorded a higher number of cases (70 since April 2024 25), a significant portion of which are linked to exposure to infected dairy cattle—an exposure route not yet relevant in Canada. Canada has reported one domestically acquired human case, linked to poultry exposure, which notably involved a virus strain with a mammalian adaptation marker.11Detections of H5N1 in wild bird populations are common in both countries, with diverse avian species affected.3 Similarly, various wild mammal species have tested positive in both nations, including foxes in Canada and a more extensive list of species in the U.S..14 Surveillance of these wildlife reservoirs is actively conducted by the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) and USDA APHIS.Table 3: Confirmed Human H5N1 Cases in Canada and the United States (2024-May 2025)

Sources: 6B. Transboundary Transmission Risks and Bilateral CooperationThe extensive shared border, interconnected ecosystems, and significant agricultural trade between Canada and the United States create inherent transboundary risks for H5N1 transmission. Migratory bird flyways traverse both countries, meaning that wild birds carrying the H5N1 virus regularly cross the border, posing a continuous and largely uncontrollable risk of viral exchange and introduction into new areas.3The movement of live animals, animal products, farm equipment, and personnel across the border, although subject to regulation, also presents potential pathways for viral transmission. The CFIA, for example, implements restrictions on the import of certain U.S. bird by-products due to HPAI concerns.1 Conversely, the U.S. relies on Canada for a portion of its egg supply, with Canadian eggs constituting over 40% of all U.S. egg imports in 2023.62 This economic interdependence means that outbreaks in one country can have direct supply and market implications for the other.Given these factors, robust bilateral cooperation on H5N1 surveillance, timely and transparent data sharing, and coordinated response strategies are essential for effective management of transboundary risks. Both Canada and the United States participate in international reporting mechanisms, such as to WOAH 10, and engage in scientific collaboration, as evidenced by the involvement of researchers from both countries in initiatives like the Global Virus Network study.2 The emergence of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle has undoubtedly heightened Canadian vigilance and biosecurity measures for its own dairy sector, demonstrating a reactive adaptation based on a neighboring country's adverse experience. This underscores how transboundary disease events can, and should, drive preemptive policy and surveillance enhancements in connected nations.V. Key Scientific Developments and Emerging Research (North America Focus)A. Viral Evolution, Genetic Clades, and Mutations of ConcernThe H5N1 avian influenza virus circulating in North America belongs to clade 2.3.4.4b, which initially spread from Eurasia and Africa, reaching the continent in 2021.10 Since its introduction, the virus has undergone further evolution. In the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak, the initial genotype identified was B3.13. However, a distinct genotype, D1.1—which was the predominant H5N1 genotype in North American wild bird flyways during the fall and winter of 2024-2025—was subsequently confirmed in infected cattle.33 Further genetic diversification is evident, as the virus isolated from a human case in Ohio, linked to poultry or dairy exposure, was identified as clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.3.25 Both the D1.1 and D1.3 genotypes are understood to have originated from an A3 genotype H5N1 virus that was introduced to North America in 2022 and subsequently reassorted with endemic North American wild bird avian influenza viruses.25 This active process of reassortment with local AIVs, leading to new genotypes circulating across multiple host species (poultry, wild birds, dairy cattle), signifies ongoing genetic exchange and adaptation. Such reassortment events can result in viruses with novel characteristics, potentially affecting host range, virulence, or transmissibility.Of particular concern are specific viral mutations associated with enhanced adaptation to mammalian hosts. The E627K mutation in the PB2 gene, known to increase viral replication efficiency in mammalian cells, has been detected in the virus from the Canadian human case 11 and in viruses from human cases in Wyoming and Nevada in the U.S..51 The repeated, independent emergence or selection of this mutation in viruses infecting humans is a significant molecular signal warranting close monitoring, as it may indicate an increased zoonotic potential or a greater likelihood of causing symptomatic human infection. While the virus from the Ohio human case did not, at the time of analysis, show markers that would impact antiviral effectiveness or existing candidate vaccine viruses, nor changes for better mammalian adaptation 25, the dynamic nature of influenza virus evolution necessitates continuous surveillance. Recent phylogenetic research has also raised concerns that even a single mutation in the H5N1 strain currently affecting dairy cattle could be sufficient to allow for more efficient binding to human-type receptors.39Despite these evolutionary changes, current assessments indicate that the H5N1 viruses circulating in the U.S. remain susceptible to available FDA-approved influenza antiviral medications.51 However, given the rapid mutation rate of influenza viruses and the vast scale of viral replication occurring in infected animal populations, the potential for antiviral resistance to emerge remains a constant concern, mandating ongoing genomic surveillance linked with antiviral susceptibility testing.B. Advances in Understanding Interspecies Transmission DynamicsThe H5N1 epizootic in North America, particularly the U.S. dairy cattle outbreak since March 2024 32, has provided new insights into the virus's capacity for interspecies transmission. While the initial jump into dairy cattle likely originated from an avian source, subsequent spread between dairy farms appears to be driven by factors such as the movement of cattle, contaminated equipment, and personnel, rather than continuous reintroduction from migratory birds.32 This points to the establishment of efficient intra-mammalian transmission routes, potentially involving fomites like milking equipment or shared environments, which are less characterized for H5N1 than direct avian-to-mammal spillover.The consumption of contaminated raw animal products has been clearly identified as a transmission pathway to other mammals. H5N1 infections in domestic cats have been directly linked to their ingestion of unpasteurized milk or colostrum from infected cows, or contaminated raw meat pet foods.33 This finding has significant implications, not only for pet safety but also as a parallel concern for potential human exposure through consumption of raw dairy products, despite the protection afforded by pasteurization in the commercial milk supply.13The first likely mammal-to-human transmission of H5N1 was reported in a Texas dairy worker 14, highlighting the zoonotic risk associated with this new mammalian reservoir. While cats are generally considered dead-end hosts for avian influenza 46, the sheer number of susceptible species now documented as infected raises concerns about the virus's adaptability.Mathematical modeling studies, such as a recent publication in Nature Communications (May 2025), suggest that H5N1 is likely spreading more extensively and often undetected within U.S. dairy herds than official reports indicate. The study posited that current intervention strategies, primarily focused on pre-movement testing of a limited number of animals, are insufficient to control the epidemic and predicted continued outbreaks in 2025.39 This suggests a pressing need for enhanced surveillance methods (e.g., more comprehensive herd testing, better interpretation of wastewater data) and potentially more stringent biosecurity measures or movement controls within the dairy industry to manage this hidden spread. The overarching concern, as highlighted by entities like the Global Virus Network, is that the continued circulation and adaptation of H5N1 in animal populations, particularly mammals, increases the opportunities for the virus to acquire the ability to spread efficiently among humans, potentially sparking a pandemic.2C. Progress in Vaccine Development and Antiviral EfficacyEfforts to develop and deploy effective vaccines against H5N1 are underway for both animal and human populations, alongside continuous monitoring of antiviral drug efficacy.In Canada, the CFIA and Health Canada are actively supporting the development of animal vaccines.9 In the United States, the USDA announced in January 2025 an update to its stockpile of vaccines for chickens, with an updated version developed by Zoetis.30 The USDA is also investing up to $100 million in research encompassing vaccines and other countermeasures.27 A notable advancement is a nanoparticle-based H5N1 vaccine candidate, targeting the currently circulating clade 2.3.4.4b. Developed by POP Biotechnologies in collaboration with the University at Buffalo, this vaccine demonstrated 100% protection in preclinical trials in mice and is being pursued for both veterinary and human medical applications. Results were published in April 2025 in Cell Biomaterials.63 Such nanoparticle platforms may offer advantages in terms of speed and adaptability of production compared to traditional egg-based influenza vaccine manufacturing methods, which could be crucial for responding to evolving viral strains or a pandemic emergency. However, the widespread implementation of animal vaccines, particularly for poultry in major exporting nations like the U.S., faces significant hurdles. These include concerns that vaccination could mask infections (making surveillance more difficult), lead to international trade restrictions from countries that do not accept vaccinated poultry, and potentially drive viral evolution.30For human pandemic preparedness, both Canada and the U.S. maintain stockpiles of H5N1 vaccines. PHAC in Canada has purchased 500,000 doses.17 In the U.S., the CDC has indicated that existing candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) are expected to be effective against the H5N1 strains currently circulating, including the virus isolated from the recent Ohio human case.25 The current strategy focuses on ensuring these stockpiled vaccines match circulating strains and can be deployed if sustained human-to-human transmission emerges, rather than on preemptive mass vaccination campaigns, given the current low risk to the general public.Regarding antiviral treatments, currently available FDA-approved influenza antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir, have been found to be effective against the H5N1 strains circulating in the U.S..25 These medications are recommended for the treatment of confirmed or suspected H5N1 infections in humans and can also be considered for post-exposure prophylaxis for individuals with significant unprotected exposures.51VI. Socio-Economic and Agricultural Sector ImpactsA. Impact on the North American Poultry and Egg IndustriesHPAI H5N1 has inflicted substantial economic damage on the North American poultry and egg industries, primarily through direct bird losses, depopulation measures, and subsequent market disruptions. In Canada, the CFIA's objectives include minimizing the financial impact on the poultry sector and maintaining crucial export markets 9, as outbreaks are known to cause "massive losses" to poultry stock.5The impact in the United States has been particularly severe, described as "unprecedented damage" to poultry flocks, which has directly contributed to record-high egg prices.34 With over 171.5 million poultry affected by May 2025 23, the supply chain for eggs has been significantly strained. This has translated into sharp increases in retail egg prices: U.S. consumers saw prices rise by 8.4% in December 2024, 13.8% in January 2025, and 12.5% in February 2025. By March 2025, the retail price of eggs was 60.4% higher than in March 2024, with an overall increase of 57.6% projected for the entirety of 2025 compared to the previous year.34 Other reports indicated that egg prices soared by 37% in 2024, and in January 2025 alone, prices jumped by more than 22%, reaching an all-time high of $7.09 per dozen in some areas, with projections suggesting prices could approach $10 per dozen by the end of the year.62 The high cost of eggs has become one of the most visible societal impacts of the H5N1 epizootic.30 This situation clearly demonstrates the vulnerability of concentrated food supply chains to animal diseases, where outbreaks in a specialized agricultural sector can rapidly translate into widespread economic pressure on consumers and affect food security for a staple protein source.The sheer scale of poultry losses has prompted discussions about control strategies beyond culling, such as vaccination. However, as previously noted, the adoption of widespread poultry vaccination in major export-oriented industries like that of the U.S. is hindered by concerns over potential trade barriers from importing countries that do not accept vaccinated poultry.30 This creates a complex dilemma between immediate disease control through established (though costly) methods and exploring potentially more sustainable long-term management strategies that might have adverse trade consequences.B. Consequences for the Dairy Sector (particularly in the US)The emergence of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle since March 2024 has introduced a new dimension of economic risk, threatening significant losses to the dairy industry and potentially leading to increased milk prices.34 Affected dairy farms experience direct economic consequences from clinical signs in their herds, which include notably reduced milk production and abnormal milk quality that must be discarded.32However, despite the widespread infection in U.S. dairy herds, the direct impact on retail milk prices for consumers has been relatively muted thus far. Dairy prices in March 2025 were reported to be 2.2% higher than in March 2024, and were actually projected to decrease by 0.8% across 2025 compared to 2024.34 This relative insulation of consumer milk prices, compared to the volatility seen in egg prices, may be attributable to several factors: the U.S. dairy herd is very large, the H5N1 infection in cattle typically causes temporary illness rather than high mortality 32, and milk from sick cows is diverted from the commercial supply.55 This contrasts sharply with the poultry industry, where entire infected flocks are depopulated, leading to immediate and often drastic supply shocks.The primary economic burden for H5N1-affected U.S. dairy farms currently stems from lost milk production, increased veterinary costs for supportive care and testing, and the expenses associated with implementing enhanced biosecurity measures.33 Animal mortality is not the main economic driver in the dairy context, unlike in poultry. USDA financial assistance programs for the dairy sector are consequently tailored to address these specific types of losses, offering compensation for discarded milk, veterinary expenses, and biosecurity planning.38In Canada, the dairy sector has thus far been spared direct impacts from H5N1, as no cases have been detected in Canadian dairy cattle.7 A key objective for the CFIA is to maintain Canada's dairy export markets, which relies on demonstrating continued freedom from the disease in its national herd.9C. Governmental Economic Support and Mitigation ProgramsGovernments in both Canada and the United States have allocated substantial financial resources to combat H5N1 and support affected agricultural sectors.In Canada, the federal government has committed $27.9 million for the 2024-2025 fiscal year to bolster the national H5N1 response. These funds are directed towards early detection, prevention, rapid response, minimizing financial impacts on producers, and supporting research efforts.9The United States has mobilized a significantly larger financial response, reflecting the scale of its outbreaks. The USDA is investing $1 billion in a comprehensive strategy to curb HPAI, protect the poultry industry, and alleviate pressure on egg prices.27 This extensive package includes $500 million for enhancing on-farm biosecurity, $400 million in financial relief for affected farmers, and $100 million for research and development of vaccines and other countermeasures.27 By late 2024, the total costs associated with the ongoing H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. had already exceeded $1.4 billion, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), encompassing compensation, indemnity payments, and other related expenses.34 Other reports indicate that the federal government had spent over $1.25 billion compensating farmers for their losses.62The USDA provides specific financial assistance programs for both poultry and dairy producers. For poultry farmers, this includes indemnity payments for depopulated flocks, with compensation rates periodically updated (e.g., increased to $16.94 per egg-laying bird in February 2025 34). For dairy producers affected by H5N1, USDA offers support for biosecurity planning and implementation, costs associated with sample collection and testing, veterinary expenses, procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) for farm workers, heat treatment for disposal of contaminated milk, and compensation for a portion of lost milk production.29This substantial government expenditure in the U.S. serves a dual purpose: it aims to provide immediate financial relief to farmers to ensure the viability of their operations, and simultaneously, it seeks to incentivize the adoption of improved biosecurity measures to reduce the likelihood and impact of future outbreaks. The significant allocation towards biosecurity assessments and cost-sharing for facility upgrades indicates a strategic approach that combines direct aid with long-term prevention. However, the structure and implementation of these large-scale compensation programs can sometimes lead to unintended consequences or perceived inequities. For example, an Illinois family farm reportedly lost the entirety of its 3,000-hen flock to H5N1 in early 2025 but received only $2,500 in compensation because most of its birds were already dead upon the USDA's arrival to conduct culling.34 This case highlights how the specifics of indemnity calculation—particularly if it primarily covers animals culled by authorities rather than those already lost to the disease—can disproportionately affect smaller operations or those where the virus progresses with extreme rapidity, pointing to the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of support mechanisms to ensure they are both effective and equitable.VII. Public Health Preparedness, Prevention, and OutlookA. Comprehensive Risk Assessment for Human PopulationsPublic health agencies in both Canada and the United States conduct ongoing risk assessments for H5N1 avian influenza in human populations. The consensus is that while the virus poses a significant threat due to its pandemic potential, the current risk of infection to the general public in both countries remains low.17 This assessment is based on the absence of evidence for efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of the currently circulating H5N1 strains.17However, this low overall risk is not uniform across the population. For individuals with close or prolonged occupational or recreational exposure to infected birds, dairy cattle, or other animals, or to environments heavily contaminated by these animals, the risk of infection is considered significantly higher—assessed as moderate to high by the U.S. CDC.17 This includes poultry workers, dairy farm workers, veterinarians, animal health responders, and individuals with backyard flocks.The primary public health concern associated with H5N1 is not widespread current infection in the general populace, but rather its pandemic potential.2 Influenza viruses are known for their capacity to mutate and reassort. If an H5N1 virus were to acquire the genetic changes necessary for efficient and sustained transmission among humans, it could trigger a global pandemic. Each instance of animal-to-human transmission provides an opportunity for the virus to further adapt to human hosts. The detection of viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation, such as the PB2 E627K substitution found in viruses from some human cases in both Canada and the U.S. 11, underscores this ongoing evolutionary pressure and the reason for heightened surveillance.B. Consolidated Prevention and Biosecurity Recommendations (General Public, Farmers, High-Risk Occupations)A cornerstone of the public health response is providing clear guidance on prevention and biosecurity. Recommendations from PHAC, CDC, and USDA are tailored to different groups:

General Public: The fundamental advice is to avoid direct contact with wild birds, sick or dead animals, and their feces or contaminated environments.21 Thorough cooking of all poultry, eggs, and meat is emphasized, as this kills the virus.21 Consumption of pasteurized dairy products is safe; raw (unpasteurized) milk and raw milk products should be avoided due to the risk of H5N1 and other pathogens.21 Practicing good hand hygiene (frequent washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer) is crucial.21 Pets should be kept away from wild birds, other wildlife, and their potentially contaminated environments; feeding pets raw milk or raw meat-based diets is discouraged, especially in areas with H5N1 activity.21


Farmers and Animal Workers (Poultry and Dairy): Strict adherence to on-farm biosecurity protocols is paramount.8 This includes measures such as controlling access to barns, dedicated clothing and footwear, regular cleaning and disinfection of premises and equipment, and preventing contact between domestic animals and wild birds or other wildlife.8 The use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)—including masks (preferably N95 respirators), eye protection, gloves, and coveralls—is strongly recommended when handling potentially infected animals or working in contaminated environments.21 Sick animals should be isolated promptly.55 Farmers and workers should monitor their animal populations closely for any signs of HPAI and report suspected cases to veterinary authorities immediately.8 Receiving an annual seasonal influenza vaccination is also recommended for animal workers, not to protect against H5N1 directly, but to reduce the risk of co-infection with human and avian influenza viruses, which could facilitate viral reassortment.21


Hunters and Trappers: Individuals handling wild game, particularly birds, should take precautions during de-feathering, cleaning, and preparation. Thorough cooking of all wild game meat, organs, and eggs is essential to kill the H5N1 virus and other potential pathogens.21

The emphasis on biosecurity for farms is critical for preventing the introduction and spread of H5N1 in domestic animal populations. However, the ubiquitous presence of the virus in wild bird reservoirs and the numerous potential pathways for viral entry onto farms (e.g., contaminated feed, water, equipment, personnel, pests) make achieving infallible biosecurity an ongoing and formidable challenge. This reality underscores the need for continuous improvement, regular auditing of biosecurity plans, and exploration of new technologies or strategies to bolster farm defenses.The strong public health advisories against the consumption of raw milk and the feeding of raw meat-based diets to pets, specifically due to H5N1 risk 21, are scientifically grounded. These recommendations align with broader food safety principles but may encounter resistance from individuals or groups who advocate for such raw products, presenting a public health communication challenge to effectively convey these specific H5N1-related risks.Table 4: Key H5N1 Prevention and Biosecurity Recommendations Summary (North America)

Sources: Consolidated from 8C. Future Outlook, Pandemic Preparedness, and Research PrioritiesThe H5N1 avian influenza situation in North America is dynamic, and the long-term outlook suggests that this virus will likely remain an endemic or frequently re-emerging zoonotic threat. This necessitates sustained, adaptable, and well-funded "One Health" preparedness efforts, integrating human, domestic animal, and wildlife health sectors. The virus's deep entrenchment in global wild bird populations 10, its demonstrated ability to infect an expanding range of mammalian species 14, and its continuous genetic evolution 11 all point to a persistent challenge. As advocated by international bodies like the Global Virus Network, future preparedness must assume ongoing risk and therefore requires long-term investment in robust surveillance systems, rapid response capabilities, continued research into viral adaptation and countermeasures, and strong public health infrastructure.2A critical aspect of pandemic preparedness is understanding the specific molecular changes that would enable the H5N1 virus to transmit efficiently and sustainably among humans. While general markers of mammalian adaptation, such as the PB2 E627K mutation, are known and monitored 11, the precise constellation of genetic changes required for pandemic emergence is not fully elucidated. The establishment of H5N1 in large, managed mammal populations, such as U.S. dairy cattle 23, and its sporadic detection in pigs 10—a known "mixing vessel" for influenza viruses—provide new and concerning environments where such adaptive evolution could occur.Consequently, key research priorities include:
Viral Evolution and Adaptation: Continued genomic surveillance of H5N1 viruses from human, domestic animal, and wildlife sources to track mutations, reassortment events, and the emergence of traits associated with increased transmissibility or pathogenicity in mammals, including humans.
Interspecies Transmission Dynamics: Further investigation into the mechanisms by which H5N1 transmits between different animal species, particularly from birds to mammals, and between mammals (e.g., within dairy herds). Understanding the role of intermediate hosts is crucial.
Vaccine and Antiviral Efficacy: Ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of current and candidate vaccines (for both animals and humans) against evolving H5N1 strains, and vigilant monitoring for the emergence of antiviral resistance. Development of novel, broadly protective, or rapidly adaptable vaccine platforms remains a high priority.
Improved Diagnostics: Development and deployment of rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests for use in diverse settings, including farms, clinics, and laboratories.
Risk Factor Analysis: Research to better understand the factors that contribute to severe disease in humans infected with H5N1, and the determinants of susceptibility to infection.
Predictive Modeling: Enhancing and utilizing mathematical models to forecast outbreak scenarios, identify high-risk areas or practices, and evaluate the potential impact of different intervention strategies, such as the Canadian bird migration modeling 17 and the U.S. dairy cattle transmission model.39
The continued transmission of H5N1 in animal populations and the occurrence of sporadic human cases serve as constant reminders that the opportunity for the virus to adapt further to humans persists.17 This underscores the imperative for a proactive and scientifically informed approach to managing this complex global health threat.VIII. ConclusionThe H5N1 avian influenza situation in Canada and the United States as of May 2025 is characterized by its complexity, dynamism, and significant implications for animal health, the agricultural economy, and public health. Wild bird populations across North America remain deeply affected, serving as a persistent reservoir for the virus and driving recurrent outbreaks in domestic poultry in both nations. While both countries face this challenge, the scale of poultry industry impact is notably larger in the U.S.A critical divergence in the epizootic is the widespread emergence and transmission of H5N1 within U.S. dairy cattle herds since early 2024. This novel development has introduced new transmission dynamics, expanded the range of mammals known to be susceptible under field conditions, and created new pathways for human exposure. To date, Canada has not detected H5N1 in its dairy cattle, a status maintained through extensive surveillance.Sporadic human infections, though rare, continue to occur in both countries, primarily linked to direct contact with infected animals. The detection of viral mutations associated with mammalian adaptation in some human and animal isolates warrants continuous vigilance, as the potential for H5N1 to evolve and gain the ability to transmit efficiently among humans remains the foremost long-term public health concern. Current risk assessments categorize the threat to the general public as low, but elevated for those with direct animal exposures.Both Canada and the United States have mounted substantial responses, involving significant financial investment and multi-agency collaboration. These efforts encompass robust surveillance in animal and human populations, outbreak control measures, promotion of biosecurity, public health guidance, and strategic investment in research and countermeasures, including vaccine development and stockpiling.The path forward requires sustained commitment to a One Health approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. Enhanced bilateral and international collaboration, continued investment in scientific research to understand viral evolution and transmission, and adaptive preparedness strategies are crucial. The H5N1 virus has repeatedly demonstrated its capacity to surprise and adapt, underscoring the need for unflagging vigilance and a proactive stance to mitigate the multifaceted risks it poses to North America and the global community.
